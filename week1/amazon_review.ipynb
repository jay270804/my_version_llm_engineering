Brew it for yourself or for all of your friends, Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters Vienna Roast is a good choice.\n",

The taste is rich, satisfying moreover lingers pleasantly on the palate. I would highly recommend this if you're lookin' for a coffee that combines exceptional taste and also lasting energy, perfect for those busy mornings or long afternoons. This roasting quality promises great freshness in every cup!\n",

       "4. Akshay (5 stars) - Better than expensive instant coffees out there. There is nothing to dislike about this coffee. The taste and aroma are fantastic. It is not at all acidic. Those who love deep roasted coffee will love this. I personally became a big fan of this brand. Just add two tbsp coffee to a filter and add hot water, let it brew taking its time, fine coffee is ready in 20 mins. Its nothing short of amazing. loved it!\n",

The smell is strong and bitter but the taste is on the more okayish side. I tried Nescafe black roast and that certainly feels more prominent in taste, dense and soluble as well as the taste lingers on the palate. Also this is not as strong I would say to wake me up.\n",
