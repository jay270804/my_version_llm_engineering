Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

Probably more than you think!\\nNov 1\\nCindy Blanco, Ph.D.\\nStefanie Schantl\\nIf you\\'ve ever tried your hand at chess, you know how many languages are involved:\\nen passant\\ncomes from French, German gives us super fast\\nblitz\\nmatches, and the bishop\\'s\\nfianchetto\\nmove comes from Italian.\\nBut there\\'s a lot more where that came from! The long history of chess is a history of language and linguistic change, too. All you have to do is listen closely…\\nWhere does the word \"chess\" come from?\\nNot surprisingly, the history of the English name\\nchess\\nall starts with a king: the Persian\\nshah!\\nToday, we pronounce that word in English as \"sha,\" since even though we have the \"h\" sound in English (like in\\nhappy\\n), we don\\'t pronounce “h” at the ends of words—but other languages have different rules, and in Persian, you pronounce the \"h\" at the end of\\nshah\\n.\\nThe Persian word was adopted into Arabic as the name of the king playing piece, and when the game made it to Europe,\\nshah\\nevolved in 2 ways. First, its meaning expanded to refer to the whole game and not just the one piece. Second, it underwent an important sound change. In many European languages, the \"h\" at the end of\\nshah\\nwas replaced with a similar sound also made at the back of the throat: the \"k\" sound. What was once\\nshah\\nbecame more like\\nshak,\\nand this evolved into the older French words\\neschec\\n(check) and\\neschecs\\n(plural name for all the pieces). The plural name is the one that was borrowed into English as\\nchess\\n!\\nOther languages got the name of the game from a different source: the Sanskrit name\\nchaturanga.\\nToday, this word can be used for a whole category of chess-like board games that evolved their own forms in cultures around the world.\\nChaturanga\\nmight also sound familiar to the yogis among you—it\\'s the same word as the four-limbed yoga plank pose!\\nIn both cases,\\nchaturanga\\nmeans \"four parts\" or \"four limbs,\" and the chess meaning traces back to the 4 military branches in India. (More on those below.)\\nChaturanga\\nwas adopted into Persian, then Arabic, and then Spanish and Portuguese, due to the long history of contact between Arabic and\\nSpanish\\nand\\nPortuguese\\n. In each new language,\\nthe pronunciation of the word changed slightly\\nto fit the language\\'s sound patterns, eventually yielding Modern Standard Arabic شطرنج (shattaranj), Spanish\\najedrez\\n, and Portuguese\\nxadrez.\\nPutting sounds in check\\nThe goal of the game is to corner the king (formerly, the\\nshah\\n), and in Persian the expression was \"to stump (or surprise) the king\":\\nshah mat.\\nThe final\\n-h\\nin this phrase also became pronounced as a \"k\" sound in French, and then in English we borrowed the word as\\ncheckmate\\n—the\\nshah\\nis cornered!\\nOther sound changes can be seen in other languages. Not all languages have a \"sh\" sound, so some languages use \"s\" instead of \"sh\" in their words for\\nchess, check\\n, and\\ncheckmate\\n!\\nYou can see the similarities of the names\\nchess, check,\\nand\\ncheckmate\\nwhen you look at languages from around the world. Take a look at the\\nlist at the end of this post\\n!\\nWhere do the names of chess pieces come from?\\nChess piece names have similarly complex, layered stories that led them to their modern forms. Some pieces started as representing the\\nchaturanga—\\n4 parts—of the army: infantry, cavalry, troops mounted on elephants, and chariots. Their job was to protect the king!\\nPawn\\nThe infantry foot soldiers were represented as the\\npawns.\\nThe English word\\npawn\\nwas adopted from the older French forms\\npoun, peon,\\nand\\npehon\\n, which simply meant soldiers on foot. Foot soldiers and pawns were allegedly from the poorest classes, which is why some languages use words for \"peasant\" and \"farmer\" for these pieces. In fact, the English word\\npeon\\nultimately comes from the same Latin word as\\npawn\\n!\\nKnight\\nToday\\'s\\nknights\\noriginated as the cavalry—soldiers on horseback. As a result, some languages use the word for the horse instead of the rider for this piece. For example, in Spanish the knight piece is known as a\\ncaballo\\n(horse)!\\nRook\\nAt some point, the original chariots became what we today know as the\\nrook.\\nThe symbol of the rook playing piece has moved quite far from the image of a speedy chariot, and in some languages (including Spanish) the rook is simply known as the \"tower\" (Spanish:\\nla torre\\n).\\nThe origins of the English word\\nrook\\nare unclear—it\\'s a word specific to chess! The English and Old French words came from Arabic\\nrukhkh,\\nwhich was\\nrukh\\nin Persian… but no one knows what it meant back then!\\nWe can see more evidence of this mysterious word in other languages as well, particularly in their word for\\ncastling.\\nThis play involves a king and rook moving at the same time, so some languages have a\\nrukh\\n-inspired word for\\ncastling\\n: For example, it\\'s\\nrochieren\\n(to castle) in German, even though the word for \"rook\" is\\nTurm\\n(tower)!\\nBishop\\nBut it\\'s the\\nbishop\\nthat\\'s undergone the most dramatic changes—both linguistically and for the shape of the playing piece.
