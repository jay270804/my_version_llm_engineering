They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.\\nYou can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.\\nPatterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.\\nAn analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.\\nWhat does the pattern consist of?\\nMost patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:\\nIntent\\nof the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.\\nMotivation\\nfurther explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.\\nStructure\\nof classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.\\nCode example\\nin one of the popular programming languages makes it easier

The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the\\nTruck\\nclass.\\nAfter a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app.\\nGreat news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the\\nTruck\\nclass. Adding\\nShips\\ninto the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.\\nAs a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the app’s behavior depending on the class of transportation objects.\\nSolution\\nThe Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the\\nnew\\noperator) with calls to a special\\nfactory\\nmethod. Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the\\nnew\\noperator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as\\nproducts.\\nSubclasses can alter the class of objects being returned by the factory\\xa0method.\\nAt first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.\\nThere’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.\\nAll products must follow the same\\xa0interface.\\nFor example, both\\nTruck\\nand\\nShip\\nclasses should implement the\\nTransport\\ninterface, which declares a method called\\ndeliver\\n. Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the\\nRoadLogistics\\nclass returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the\\nSeaLogistics\\nclass returns ships.\\nAs long as all product classes implement a common interface, you can pass their objects to the client code without breaking\\xa0it.\\nThe code that uses the factory method (often called the\\nclient\\ncode) doesn’t see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. The client treats all the products as abstract\\nTransport\\n. The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the\\ndeliver\\nmethod, but exactly how it works isn’t important to the client.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nProduct\\ndeclares the interface, which is common to all objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.\\nConcrete Products\\nare different implementations of the product interface.\\nThe\\nCreator\\nclass declares the factory method that returns new product objects. It’s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.\\nYou can declare the factory method as\\nabstract\\nto force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type.\\nNote, despite its name, product creation is\\nnot\\nthe primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some core business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function of the company as a whole is still writing code, not producing programmers.\\nConcrete Creators\\noverride the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.\\nNote that the factory method doesn’t have to\\ncreate\\nnew instances all the time. It can also return existing objects from a cache, an object pool, or another source.\\nPseudocode\\nThis example illustrates how the\\nFactory Method\\ncan be used for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the client code to concrete UI classes.\\nThe cross-platform dialog\\xa0example.\\nThe base\\nDialog\\nclass uses different UI elements to render its window. Under various operating systems, these elements may look a little bit different, but they should still behave consistently. A button in Windows is still a button in Linux.\\nWhen the factory method comes into play, you don’t need to rewrite the logic of the\\nDialog\\nclass for each operating system. If we declare a factory method that produces buttons inside the base\\nDialog\\nclass, we can later create a subclass that returns Windows-styled buttons from the factory method. The subclass then inherits most of the code from the base class, but, thanks to the factory method, can render Windows-looking buttons on the screen.\\nFor this pattern to work, the base\\nDialog\\nclass must work with abstract buttons: a base class or an interface that all concrete buttons follow. This way the code within\\nDialog\\nremains functional, whichever type of buttons it works with.\\nOf course, you can apply this approach to other UI elements as well. However, with each new factory method you add to the\\nDialog\\n, you get closer to the\\nAbstract Factory\\npattern. Fear not, we’ll talk about this pattern later.\\n// The creator class declares the factory method that must\\n// return an object of a product class. The creator\\'s subclasses\\n// usually provide the implementation of this method.\\nclass Dialog is\\n    // The creator may also provide some default implementation\\n    // of the factory method.\\n    abstract method createButton():Button\\n\\n    // Note that, despite its name, the creator\\'s primary\\n    // responsibility isn\\'t creating products. It usually\\n    // contains some core business logic that relies on product\\n    // objects returned by the factory method. Subclasses can\\n    // indirectly change that business logic by overriding the\\n    // factory method and returning a different type of product\\n    // from it.\\n    method render() is\\n        // Call the factory method to create a product object.\\n        Button okButton = createButton()\\n        // Now use the product.\\n        okButton.onClick(closeDialog)\\n        okButton.render()\\n\\n\\n// Concrete creators override the factory method to change the\\n// resulting product\\'s type.\\nclass WindowsDialog extends Dialog is\\n    method createButton():Button is\\n        return new WindowsButton()\\n\\nclass WebDialog extends Dialog is\\n    method createButton():Button is\\n        return new HTMLButton()\\n\\n\\n// The product interface declares the operations that all\\n// concrete products must implement.\\ninterface Button is\\n    method render()\\n    method onClick(f)\\n\\n// Concrete products provide various implementations of the\\n// product interface.\\nclass WindowsButton implements Button is\\n    method render(a, b) is\\n        // Render a button in Windows style.\\n    method onClick(f) is\\n        // Bind a native OS click event.\\n\\nclass HTMLButton implements Button is\\n    method render(a, b) is\\n        // Return an HTML representation of a button.\\n    method onClick(f) is\\n        // Bind a web browser click event.\\n\\n\\nclass Application is\\n    field dialog: Dialog\\n\\n    // The application picks a creator\\'s type depending on the\\n    // current configuration or environment settings.\\n    method initialize() is\\n        config = readApplicationConfigFile()\\n\\n        if (config.OS == \"Windows\") then\\n            dialog = new WindowsDialog()\\n        else if (config.OS == \"Web\") then\\n            dialog = new WebDialog()\\n        else\\n            throw new Exception(\"Error! Unknown operating system.\")\\n\\n    // The client code works with an instance of a concrete\\n    // creator, albeit through its base interface. As long as\\n    // the client keeps working with the creator via the base\\n    // interface, you can pass it any creator\\'s subclass.\\n    method main() is\\n        this.initialize()\\n        dialog.render()\\nApplicability\\nUse the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.\\nThe Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.\\nFor example, to add a new product type to the app, you’ll only need to create a new creator subclass and override the factory method in it.\\nUse the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.\\nInheritance is probably the easiest way to extend the default behavior of a library or framework. But how would the framework recognize that your subclass should be used instead of a standard component?\\nThe solution is to reduce the code that constructs components across the framework into a single factory method and let anyone override this method in addition to extending the component itself.\\nLet’s see how that would work. Imagine that you write an app using an open source UI framework. Your app should have round buttons, but the framework only provides square ones. You extend the standard\\nButton\\nclass with a glorious\\nRoundButton\\nsubclass. But now you need to tell the main\\nUIFramework\\nclass to use the new button subclass instead of a default one.\\nTo achieve this, you create a subclass\\nUIWithRoundButtons\\nfrom a base framework class and override its\\ncreateButton\\nmethod. While this method returns\\nButton\\nobjects in the base class, you make your subclass return\\nRoundButton\\nobjects. Now use the\\nUIWithRoundButtons\\nclass instead of\\nUIFramework\\n. And that’s about it!\\nUse the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.\\nYou often experience this need when dealing with large, resource-intensive objects such as database connections, file systems, and network resources.\\nLet’s think about what has to be done to reuse an existing object:\\nFirst, you need to create some storage to keep track of all of the created objects.\\nWhen someone requests an object, the program should look for a free object inside that pool.\\n… and then return it to the client code.\\nIf there are no free objects, the program should create a new one (and add it to the pool).\\nThat’s a lot of code! And it must all be put into a single place so that you don’t pollute the program with duplicate code.\\nProbably the most obvious and convenient place where this code could be placed is the constructor of the class whose objects we’re trying to reuse. However, a constructor must always return\\nnew objects\\nby definition. It can’t return existing instances.\\nTherefore, you need to have a regular method capable of creating new objects as well as reusing existing ones. That sounds very much like a factory method.\\nHow to Implement\\nMake all products follow the same interface. This interface should declare methods that make sense in every product.\\nAdd an empty factory method inside the creator class. The return type of the method should match the common product interface.\\nIn the creator’s code find all references to product constructors. One by one, replace them with calls to the factory method, while extracting the product creation code into the factory method.\\nYou might need to add a temporary parameter to the factory method to control the type of returned product.\\nAt this point, the code of the factory method may look pretty ugly. It may have a large\\nswitch\\nstatement that picks which product class to instantiate. But don’t worry, we’ll fix it soon enough.\\nNow, create a set of creator subclasses for each type of product listed in the factory method. Override the factory method in the subclasses and extract the appropriate bits of construction code from the base method.\\nIf there are too many product types and it doesn’t make sense to create subclasses for all of them, you can reuse the control parameter from the base class in subclasses.\\nFor instance, imagine that you have the following hierarchy of classes: the base\\nMail\\nclass with a couple of subclasses:\\nAirMail\\nand\\nGroundMail\\n; the\\nTransport\\nclasses are\\nPlane\\n,\\nTruck\\nand\\nTrain\\n. While the\\nAirMail\\nclass only uses\\nPlane\\nobjects,\\nGroundMail\\nmay work with both\\nTruck\\nand\\nTrain\\nobjects. You can create a new subclass (say\\nTrainMail\\n) to handle both cases, but there’s another option. The client code can pass an argument to the factory method of the\\nGroundMail\\nclass to control which product it wants to receive.\\nIf, after all of the extractions, the base factory method has become empty, you can make it abstract. If there’s something left, you can make it a default behavior of the method.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.\\nThe code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when you’re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nMany designs start by using\\nFactory Method\\n(less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward\\nAbstract Factory\\n,\\nPrototype\\n, or\\nBuilder\\n(more flexible, but more complicated).\\nAbstract Factory\\nclasses are often based on a set of\\nFactory Methods\\n, but you can also use\\nPrototype\\nto compose the methods on these classes.\\nYou can use\\nFactory Method\\nalong with\\nIterator\\nto let collection subclasses return different types of iterators that are compatible with the collections.\\nPrototype\\nisn’t based on inheritance, so it doesn’t have its drawbacks. On the other hand,\\nPrototype\\nrequires a complicated initialization of the cloned object.\\nFactory Method\\nis based on inheritance but doesn’t require an initialization step.\\nFactory Method\\nis a specialization of\\nTemplate Method\\n.

title:\\nAbstract Factory\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nCreational Patterns\\nAbstract Factory\\nIntent\\nAbstract Factory\\nis a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete\\xa0classes.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you’re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:\\nA family of related products, say:\\nChair\\n+\\nSofa\\n+\\nCoffeeTable\\n.\\nSeveral variants of this family. For example, products\\nChair\\n+\\nSofa\\n+\\nCoffeeTable\\nare available in these variants:\\nModern\\n,\\nVictorian\\n,\\nArtDeco\\n.\\nYou need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite mad when they receive non-matching furniture.\\nA Modern-style sofa doesn’t match Victorian-style\\xa0chairs.\\nAlso, you don’t want to change existing code when adding new products or families of products to the program. Furniture vendors update their catalogs very often, and you wouldn’t want to change the core code each time it happens.\\nSolution\\nThe first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family (e.g., chair, sofa or coffee table). Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all chair variants can implement the\\nChair\\ninterface; all coffee table variants can implement the\\nCoffeeTable\\ninterface, and so on.\\nAll variants of the same object must be moved to a single class\\xa0hierarchy.\\nThe next move is to declare the\\nAbstract Factory\\n—an interface with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family (for example,\\ncreateChair\\n,\\ncreateSofa\\nand\\ncreateCoffeeTable\\n). These methods must return\\nabstract\\nproduct types represented by the interfaces we extracted previously:\\nChair\\n,\\nSofa\\n,\\nCoffeeTable\\nand so on.\\nEach concrete factory corresponds to a specific product\\xa0variant.\\nNow, how about the product variants? For each variant of a product family, we create a separate factory class based on the\\nAbstractFactory\\ninterface. A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind. For example, the\\nModernFurnitureFactory\\ncan only create\\nModernChair\\n,\\nModernSofa\\nand\\nModernCoffeeTable\\nobjects.\\nThe client code has to work with both factories and products via their respective abstract interfaces. This lets you change the type of a factory that you pass to the client code, as well as the product variant that the client code receives, without breaking the actual client code.\\nThe client shouldn’t care about the concrete class of the factory it works\\xa0with.\\nSay the client wants a factory to produce a chair. The client doesn’t have to be aware of the factory’s class, nor does it matter what kind of chair it gets. Whether it’s a Modern model or a Victorian-style chair, the client must treat all chairs in the same manner, using the abstract\\nChair\\ninterface. With this approach, the only thing that the client knows about the chair is that it implements the\\nsitOn\\nmethod in some way. Also, whichever variant of the chair is returned, it’ll always match the type of sofa or coffee table produced by the same factory object.\\nThere’s one more thing left to clarify: if the client is only exposed to the abstract interfaces, what creates the actual factory objects? Usually, the application creates a concrete factory object at the initialization stage. Just before that, the app must select the factory type depending on the configuration or the environment settings.\\nStructure\\nAbstract Products\\ndeclare interfaces for a set of distinct but related products which make up a product family.\\nConcrete Products\\nare various implementations of abstract products, grouped by variants. Each abstract product (chair/sofa) must be implemented in all given variants (Victorian/Modern).\\nThe\\nAbstract Factory\\ninterface declares a set of methods for creating each of the abstract products.\\nConcrete Factories\\nimplement creation methods of the abstract factory. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant of products and creates only those product variants.\\nAlthough concrete factories instantiate concrete products, signatures of their creation methods must return corresponding\\nabstract\\nproducts. This way the client code that uses a factory doesn’t get coupled to the specific variant of the product it gets from a factory. The\\nClient\\ncan work with any concrete factory/product variant, as long as it communicates with their objects via abstract interfaces.\\nPseudocode\\nThis example illustrates how the\\nAbstract Factory\\npattern can be used for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the client code to concrete UI classes, while keeping all created elements consistent with a selected operating system.\\nThe cross-platform UI classes\\xa0example.\\nThe same UI elements in a cross-platform application are expected to behave similarly, but look a little bit different under different operating systems. Moreover, it’s your job to make sure that the UI elements match the style of the current operating system. You wouldn’t want your program to render macOS controls when it’s executed in Windows.\\nThe Abstract Factory interface declares a set of creation methods that the client code can use to produce different types of UI elements. Concrete factories correspond to specific operating systems and create the UI elements that match that particular OS.\\nIt works like this: when an application launches, it checks the type of the current operating system. The app uses this information to create a factory object from a class that matches the operating system. The rest of the code uses this factory to create UI elements. This prevents the wrong elements from being created.\\nWith this approach, the client code doesn’t depend on concrete classes of factories and UI elements as long as it works with these objects via their abstract interfaces. This also lets the client code support other factories or UI elements that you might add in the future.\\nAs a result, you don’t need to modify the client code each time you add a new variation of UI elements to your app. You just have to create a new factory class that produces these elements and slightly modify the app’s initialization code so it selects that class when appropriate.\\n// The abstract factory interface declares a set of methods that\\n// return different abstract products. These products are called\\n// a family and are related by a high-level theme or concept.\\n// Products of one family are usually able to collaborate among\\n// themselves. A family of products may have several variants,\\n// but the products of one variant are incompatible with the\\n// products of another variant.\\ninterface GUIFactory is\\n    method createButton():Button\\n    method createCheckbox():Checkbox\\n\\n\\n// Concrete factories produce a family of products that belong\\n// to a single variant. The factory guarantees that the\\n// resulting products are compatible. Signatures of the concrete\\n// factory\\'s methods return an abstract product, while inside\\n// the method a concrete product is instantiated.\\nclass WinFactory implements GUIFactory is\\n    method createButton():Button is\\n        return new WinButton()\\n    method createCheckbox():Checkbox is\\n        return new WinCheckbox()\\n\\n// Each concrete factory has a corresponding product variant.\\nclass MacFactory implements GUIFactory is\\n    method createButton():Button is\\n        return new MacButton()\\n    method createCheckbox():Checkbox is\\n        return new MacCheckbox()\\n\\n\\n// Each distinct product of a product family should have a base\\n// interface. All variants of the product must implement this\\n// interface.\\ninterface Button is\\n    method paint()\\n\\n// Concrete products are created by corresponding concrete\\n// factories.\\nclass WinButton implements Button is\\n    method paint() is\\n        // Render a button in Windows style.\\n\\nclass MacButton implements Button is\\n    method paint() is\\n        // Render a button in macOS style.\\n\\n// Here\\'s the base interface of another product. All products\\n// can interact with each other, but proper interaction is\\n// possible only between products of the same concrete variant.\\ninterface Checkbox is\\n    method paint()\\n\\nclass WinCheckbox implements Checkbox is\\n    method paint() is\\n        // Render a checkbox in Windows style.\\n\\nclass MacCheckbox implements Checkbox is\\n    method paint() is\\n        // Render a checkbox in macOS style.\\n\\n\\n// The client code works with factories and products only\\n// through abstract types: GUIFactory, Button and Checkbox. This\\n// lets you pass any factory or product subclass to the client\\n// code without breaking it.\\nclass Application is\\n    private field factory: GUIFactory\\n    private field button: Button\\n    constructor Application(factory: GUIFactory) is\\n        this.factory = factory\\n    method createUI() is\\n        this.button = factory.createButton()\\n    method paint() is\\n        button.paint()\\n\\n\\n// The application picks the factory type depending on the\\n// current configuration or environment settings and creates it\\n// at runtime (usually at the initialization stage).\\nclass ApplicationConfigurator is\\n    method main() is\\n        config = readApplicationConfigFile()\\n\\n        if (config.OS == \"Windows\") then\\n            factory = new WinFactory()\\n        else if (config.OS == \"Mac\") then\\n            factory = new MacFactory()\\n        else\\n            throw new Exception(\"Error! Unknown operating system.\")\\n\\n        Application app = new Application(factory)\\nApplicability\\nUse the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.\\nThe Abstract Factory provides you with an interface for creating objects from each class of the product family. As long as your code creates objects via this interface, you don’t have to worry about creating the wrong variant of a product which doesn’t match the products already created by your app.\\nConsider implementing the Abstract Factory when you have a class with a set of\\nFactory Methods\\nthat blur its primary responsibility.\\nIn a well-designed program\\neach class is responsible only for one thing\\n. When a class deals with multiple product types, it may be worth extracting its factory methods into a stand-alone factory class or a full-blown Abstract Factory implementation.\\nHow to Implement\\nMap out a matrix of distinct product types versus variants of these products.\\nDeclare abstract product interfaces for all product types. Then make all concrete product classes implement these interfaces.\\nDeclare the abstract factory interface with a set of creation methods for all abstract products.\\nImplement a set of concrete factory classes, one for each product variant.\\nCreate factory initialization code somewhere in the app. It should instantiate one of the concrete factory classes, depending on the application configuration or the current environment. Pass this factory object to all classes that construct products.\\nScan through the code and find all direct calls to product constructors. Replace them with calls to the appropriate creation method on the factory object.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can be sure that the products you’re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.\\nYou avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.\\nThe code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nMany designs start by using\\nFactory Method\\n(less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward\\nAbstract Factory\\n,\\nPrototype\\n, or\\nBuilder\\n(more flexible, but more complicated).\\nBuilder\\nfocuses on constructing complex objects step by step.\\nAbstract Factory\\nspecializes in creating families of related objects.\\nAbstract Factory\\nreturns the product immediately, whereas\\nBuilder\\nlets you run some additional construction steps before fetching the product.\\nAbstract Factory\\nclasses are often based on a set of\\nFactory Methods\\n, but you can also use\\nPrototype\\nto compose the methods on these classes.\\nAbstract Factory\\ncan serve as an alternative to\\nFacade\\nwhen you only want to hide the way the subsystem objects are created from the client code.\\nYou can use\\nAbstract Factory\\nalong with\\nBridge\\n. This pairing is useful when some abstractions defined by\\nBridge\\ncan only work with specific implementations.

title:\\nBuilder\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nCreational Patterns\\nBuilder\\nIntent\\nBuilder\\nis a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction\\xa0code.\\nProblem\\nImagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.\\nFor example, let’s think about how to create a\\nHouse\\nobject. To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor, install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. But what if you want a bigger, brighter house, with a backyard and other goodies (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)?\\nThe simplest solution is to extend the base\\nHouse\\nclass and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. But eventually you’ll end up with a considerable number of subclasses. Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more.\\nThere’s another approach that doesn’t involve breeding subclasses. You can create a giant constructor right in the base\\nHouse\\nclass with all possible parameters that control the house object. While this approach indeed eliminates the need for subclasses, it creates another problem.\\nThe constructor with lots of parameters has its downside: not all the parameters are needed at all\\xa0times.\\nIn most cases most of the parameters will be unused, making\\nthe constructor calls pretty ugly\\n. For instance, only a fraction of houses have swimming pools, so the parameters related to swimming pools will be useless nine times out of ten.\\nSolution\\nThe Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called\\nbuilders\\n.\\nThe Builder pattern lets you construct complex objects step by step. The Builder doesn’t allow other objects to access the product while it’s being\\xa0built.\\nThe pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps (\\nbuildWalls\\n,\\nbuildDoor\\n,\\xa0etc.). To create an object, you execute a series of these steps on a builder object. The important part is that you don’t need to call all of the steps. You can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.\\nSome of the construction steps might require different implementation when you need to build various representations of the product. For example, walls of a cabin may be built of wood, but the castle walls must be built with stone.\\nIn this case, you can create several different builder classes that implement the same set of building steps, but in a different manner. Then you can use these builders in the construction process (i.e., an ordered set of calls to the building steps) to produce different kinds of objects.\\nDifferent builders execute the same task in various\\xa0ways.\\nFor example, imagine a builder that builds everything from wood and glass, a second one that builds everything with stone and iron and a third one that uses gold and diamonds. By calling the same set of steps, you get a regular house from the first builder, a small castle from the second and a palace from the third. However, this would only work if the client code that calls the building steps is able to interact with builders using a common interface.\\nDirector\\nYou can go further and extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called\\ndirector\\n. The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps.\\nThe director knows which building steps to execute to get a working\\xa0product.\\nHaving a director class in your program isn’t strictly necessary. You can always call the building steps in a specific order directly from the client code. However, the director class might be a good place to put various construction routines so you can reuse them across your program.\\nIn addition, the director class completely hides the details of product construction from the client code. The client only needs to associate a builder with a director, launch the construction with the director, and get the result from the builder.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nBuilder\\ninterface declares product construction steps that are common to all types of builders.\\nConcrete Builders\\nprovide different implementations of the construction steps. Concrete builders may produce products that don’t follow the common interface.\\nProducts\\nare resulting objects. Products constructed by different builders don’t have to belong to the same class hierarchy or interface.\\nThe\\nDirector\\nclass defines the order in which to call construction steps, so you can create and reuse specific configurations of products.\\nThe\\nClient\\nmust associate one of the builder objects with the director. Usually, it’s done just once, via parameters of the director’s constructor. Then the director uses that builder object for all further construction. However, there’s an alternative approach for when the client passes the builder object to the production method of the director. In this case, you can use a different builder each time you produce something with the director.\\nPseudocode\\nThis example of the\\nBuilder\\npattern illustrates how you can reuse the same object construction code when building different types of products, such as cars, and create the corresponding manuals for them.\\nThe example of step-by-step construction of cars and the user guides that fit those car\\xa0models.\\nA car is a complex object that can be constructed in a hundred different ways. Instead of bloating the\\nCar\\nclass with a huge constructor, we extracted the car assembly code into a separate car builder class. This class has a set of methods for configuring various parts of a car.\\nIf the client code needs to assemble a special, fine-tuned model of a car, it can work with the builder directly. On the other hand, the client can delegate the assembly to the director class, which knows how to use a builder to construct several of the most popular models of cars.\\nYou might be shocked, but every car needs a manual (seriously, who reads them?). The manual describes every feature of the car, so the details in the manuals vary across the different models. That’s why it makes sense to reuse an existing construction process for both real cars and their respective manuals. Of course, building a manual isn’t the same as building a car, and that’s why we must provide another builder class that specializes in composing manuals. This class implements the same building methods as its car-building sibling, but instead of crafting car parts, it describes them. By passing these builders to the same director object, we can construct either a car or a manual.\\nThe final part is fetching the resulting object. A metal car and a paper manual, although related, are still very different things. We can’t place a method for fetching results in the director without coupling the director to concrete product classes. Hence, we obtain the result of the construction from the builder which performed the job.\\n// Using the Builder pattern makes sense only when your products\\n// are quite complex and require extensive configuration. The\\n// following two products are related, although they don\\'t have\\n// a common interface.\\nclass Car is\\n    // A car can have a GPS, trip computer and some number of\\n    // seats.

Calling such a beast is very inconvenient; therefore, you overload the constructor and create several shorter versions with fewer parameters. These constructors still refer to the main one, passing some default values into any omitted parameters.\\nclass Pizza {\\n    Pizza(int size) { ... }\\n    Pizza(int size, boolean cheese) { ... }\\n    Pizza(int size, boolean cheese, boolean pepperoni) { ... }\\n    // ...\\nCreating such a monster is only possible in languages that support method overloading, such as C# or\\xa0Java.\\nThe Builder pattern lets you build objects step by step, using only those steps that you really need. After implementing the pattern, you don’t have to cram dozens of parameters into your constructors anymore.\\nUse the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product (for example, stone and wooden houses).\\nThe Builder pattern can be applied when construction of various representations of the product involves similar steps that differ only in the details.\\nThe base builder interface defines all possible construction steps, and concrete builders implement these steps to construct particular representations of the product. Meanwhile, the director class guides the order of construction.\\nUse the Builder to construct\\nComposite\\ntrees or other complex objects.\\nThe Builder pattern lets you construct products step-by-step. You could defer execution of some steps without breaking the final product. You can even call steps recursively, which comes in handy when you need to build an object tree.\\nA builder doesn’t expose the unfinished product while running construction steps. This prevents the client code from fetching an incomplete result.\\nHow to Implement\\nMake sure that you can clearly define the common construction steps for building all available product representations. Otherwise, you won’t be able to proceed with implementing the pattern.\\nDeclare these steps in the base builder interface.\\nCreate a concrete builder class for each of the product representations and implement their construction steps.\\nDon’t forget about implementing a method for fetching the result of the construction. The reason why this method can’t be declared inside the builder interface is that various builders may construct products that don’t have a common interface. Therefore, you don’t know what would be the return type for such a method. However, if you’re dealing with products from a single hierarchy, the fetching method can be safely added to the base interface.\\nThink about creating a director class. It may encapsulate various ways to construct a product using the same builder object.\\nThe client code creates both the builder and the director objects. Before construction starts, the client must pass a builder object to the director. Usually, the client does this only once, via parameters of the director’s class constructor. The director uses the builder object in all further construction. There’s an alternative approach, where the builder is passed to a specific product construction method of the director.\\nThe construction result can be obtained directly from the director only if all products follow the same interface. Otherwise, the client should fetch the result from the builder.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can construct objects step-by-step, defer construction steps or run steps recursively.\\nYou can reuse the same construction code when building various representations of products.\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the product.\\nThe overall complexity of the code increases since the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nMany designs start by using\\nFactory Method\\n(less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward\\nAbstract Factory\\n,\\nPrototype\\n, or\\nBuilder\\n(more flexible, but more complicated).\\nBuilder\\nfocuses on constructing complex objects step by step.\\nAbstract Factory\\nspecializes in creating families of related objects.\\nAbstract Factory\\nreturns the product immediately, whereas\\nBuilder\\nlets you run some additional construction steps before fetching the product.\\nYou can use\\nBuilder\\nwhen creating complex\\nComposite\\ntrees because you can program its construction steps to work recursively.\\nYou can combine\\nBuilder\\nwith\\nBridge\\n: the director class plays the role of the abstraction, while different builders act as implementations.\\nAbstract Factories\\n,\\nBuilders\\nand\\nPrototypes\\ncan all be implemented as\\nSingletons\\n.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own

title:\\nPrototype\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nCreational Patterns\\nPrototype\\nAlso known as:\\nClone\\nIntent\\nPrototype\\nis a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their\\xa0classes.\\nProblem\\nSay you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy of it. How would you do it? First, you have to create a new object of the same class. Then you have to go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object.\\nNice! But there’s a catch. Not all objects can be copied that way because some of the object’s fields may be private and not visible from outside of the object itself.\\nThere’s one more problem with the direct approach. Since you have to know the object’s class to create a duplicate, your code becomes dependent on that class. If the extra dependency doesn’t scare you, there’s another catch. Sometimes you only know the interface that the object follows, but not its concrete class, when, for example, a parameter in a method accepts any objects that follow some interface.\\nSolution\\nThe Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned. The pattern declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning. This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your code to the class of that object. Usually, such an interface contains just a single\\nclone\\nmethod.\\nThe implementation of the\\nclone\\nmethod is very similar in all classes. The method creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field values of the old object into the new one. You can even copy private fields because most programming languages let objects access private fields of other objects that belong to the same class.\\nAn object that supports cloning is called a\\nprototype\\n. When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing.\\nPre-built prototypes can be an alternative to\\xa0subclassing.\\nHere’s how it works: you create a set of objects, configured in various ways. When you need an object like the one you’ve configured, you just clone a prototype instead of constructing a new object from scratch.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nIn real life, prototypes are used for performing various tests before starting mass production of a product. However, in this case, prototypes don’t participate in any actual production, playing a passive role instead.\\nThe division of a\\xa0cell.\\nSince industrial prototypes don’t really copy themselves, a much closer analogy to the pattern is the process of mitotic cell division (biology, remember?). After mitotic division, a pair of identical cells is formed. The original cell acts as a prototype and takes an active role in creating the copy.\\nStructure\\nBasic implementation\\nThe\\nPrototype\\ninterface declares the cloning methods. In most cases, it’s a single\\nclone\\nmethod.\\nThe\\nConcrete Prototype\\nclass implements the cloning method. In addition to copying the original object’s data to the clone, this method may also handle some edge cases of the cloning process related to cloning linked objects, untangling recursive dependencies,\\xa0etc.\\nThe\\nClient\\ncan produce a copy of any object that follows the prototype interface.\\nPrototype registry implementation\\nThe\\nPrototype Registry\\nprovides an easy way to access frequently-used prototypes. It stores a set of pre-built objects that are ready to be copied. The simplest prototype registry is a\\nname → prototype\\nhash map. However, if you need better search criteria than a simple name, you can build a much more robust version of the registry.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nPrototype\\npattern lets you produce exact copies of geometric objects, without coupling the code to their classes.\\nCloning a set of objects that belong to a class\\xa0hierarchy.\\nAll shape classes follow the same interface, which provides a cloning method. A subclass may call the parent’s cloning method before copying its own field values to the resulting object.\\n// Base prototype.\\nabstract class Shape is\\n    field X: int\\n    field Y: int\\n    field color: string\\n\\n    // A regular constructor.\\n    constructor Shape() is\\n        // ...\\n\\n    // The prototype constructor. A fresh object is initialized\\n    // with values from the existing object.\\n    constructor Shape(source: Shape) is\\n        this()\\n        this.X = source.X\\n        this.Y = source.Y\\n        this.color = source.color\\n\\n    // The clone operation returns one of the Shape subclasses.\\n    abstract method clone():Shape\\n\\n\\n// Concrete prototype. The cloning method creates a new object\\n// in one go by calling the constructor of the current class and\\n// passing the current object as the constructor\\'s argument.\\n// Performing all the actual copying in the constructor helps to\\n// keep the result consistent: the constructor will not return a\\n// result until the new object is fully built; thus, no object\\n// can have a reference to a partially-built clone.\\nclass Rectangle extends Shape is\\n    field width: int\\n    field height: int\\n\\n    constructor Rectangle(source: Rectangle) is\\n        // A parent constructor call is needed to copy private\\n        // fields defined in the parent class.\\n        super(source)\\n        this.width = source.width\\n        this.height = source.height\\n\\n    method clone():Shape is\\n        return new Rectangle(this)\\n\\n\\nclass Circle extends Shape is\\n    field radius: int\\n\\n    constructor Circle(source: Circle) is\\n        super(source)\\n        this.radius = source.radius\\n\\n    method clone():Shape is\\n        return new Circle(this)\\n\\n\\n// Somewhere in the client code.\\nclass Application is\\n    field shapes: array of Shape\\n\\n    constructor Application() is\\n        Circle circle = new Circle()\\n        circle.X = 10\\n        circle.Y = 10\\n        circle.radius = 20\\n        shapes.add(circle)\\n\\n        Circle anotherCircle = circle.clone()\\n        shapes.add(anotherCircle)\\n        // The `anotherCircle` variable contains an exact copy\\n        // of the `circle` object.\\n\\n        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle()\\n        rectangle.width = 10\\n        rectangle.height = 20\\n        shapes.add(rectangle)\\n\\n    method businessLogic() is\\n        // Prototype rocks because it lets you produce a copy of\\n        // an object without knowing anything about its type.\\n        Array shapesCopy = new Array of Shapes.\\n\\n        // For instance, we don\\'t know the exact elements in the\\n        // shapes array. All we know is that they are all\\n        // shapes. But thanks to polymorphism, when we call the\\n        // `clone` method on a shape the program checks its real\\n        // class and runs the appropriate clone method defined\\n        // in that class. That\\'s why we get proper clones\\n        // instead of a set of simple Shape objects.\\n        foreach (s in shapes) do\\n            shapesCopy.add(s.clone())\\n\\n        // The `shapesCopy` array contains exact copies of the\\n        // `shape` array\\'s children.\\nApplicability\\nUse the Prototype pattern when your code shouldn’t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.\\nThis happens a lot when your code works with objects passed to you from 3rd-party code via some interface. The concrete classes of these objects are unknown, and you couldn’t depend on them even if you wanted to.\\nThe Prototype pattern provides the client code with a general interface for working with all objects that support cloning. This interface makes the client code independent from the concrete classes of objects that it clones.\\nUse the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.\\nSuppose you have a complex class that requires a laborious configuration before it can be used. There are several common ways to configure this class, and this code is scattered through your app. To reduce the duplication, you create several subclasses and put every common configuration code into their constructors. You solved the duplication problem, but now you have lots of dummy subclasses.\\nThe Prototype pattern lets you use a set of pre-built objects configured in various ways as prototypes. Instead of instantiating a subclass that matches some configuration, the client can simply look for an appropriate prototype and clone it.\\nHow to Implement\\nCreate the prototype interface and declare the\\nclone\\nmethod in it. Or just add the method to all classes of an existing class hierarchy, if you have one.\\nA prototype class must define the alternative constructor that accepts an object of that class as an argument. The constructor must copy the values of all fields defined in the class from the passed object into the newly created instance. If you’re changing a subclass, you must call the parent constructor to let the superclass handle the cloning of its private fields.\\nIf your programming language doesn’t support method overloading, you won’t be able to create a separate “prototype” constructor. Thus, copying the object’s data into the newly created clone will have to be performed within the\\nclone\\nmethod. Still, having this code in a regular constructor is safer because the resulting object is returned fully configured right after you call the\\nnew\\noperator.\\nThe cloning method usually consists of just one line: running a\\nnew\\noperator with the prototypical version of the constructor. Note, that every class must explicitly override the cloning method and use its own class name along with the\\nnew\\noperator. Otherwise, the cloning method may produce an object of a parent class.\\nOptionally, create a centralized prototype registry to store a catalog of frequently used prototypes.\\nYou can implement the registry as a new factory class or put it in the base prototype class with a static method for fetching the prototype. This method should search for a prototype based on search criteria that the client code passes to the method. The criteria might either be a simple string tag or a complex set of search parameters. After the appropriate prototype is found, the registry should clone it and return the copy to the client.\\nFinally, replace the direct calls to the subclasses’ constructors with calls to the factory method of the prototype registry.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.\\nYou can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.\\nYou can produce complex objects more conveniently.\\nYou get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.\\nCloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nMany designs start by using\\nFactory Method\\n(less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward\\nAbstract Factory\\n,\\nPrototype\\n, or\\nBuilder\\n(more flexible, but more complicated).\\nAbstract Factory\\nclasses are often based on a set of\\nFactory Methods\\n, but you can also use\\nPrototype\\nto compose the methods on these classes.\\nPrototype\\ncan help when you need to save copies of\\nCommands\\ninto history.\\nDesigns that make heavy use of\\nComposite\\nand\\nDecorator\\ncan often benefit from using\\nPrototype\\n. Applying the pattern lets you clone complex structures instead of re-constructing them from scratch.\\nPrototype\\nisn’t based on inheritance, so it doesn’t have its drawbacks. On the other hand,\\nPrototype\\nrequires a complicated initialization of the cloned object.\\nFactory Method\\nis based on inheritance but doesn’t require an initialization step.\\nSometimes\\nPrototype\\ncan be a simpler alternative to\\nMemento\\n. This works if the object, the state of which you want to store in the history, is fairly straightforward and doesn’t have links to external resources, or the links are easy to re-establish.\\nAbstract Factories\\n,\\nBuilders\\nand\\nPrototypes\\ncan all be implemented as\\nSingletons\\n.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained

class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this\\xa0instance.\\nProblem\\nThe Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n:\\nEnsure that a class has just a single instance\\n. Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource—for example, a database or a file.\\nHere’s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created.\\nNote that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call\\nmust\\nalways return a new object by design.\\nProvide a global access point to that instance\\n. Remember those global variables that you (all right, me) used to store some essential objects? While they’re very handy, they’re also very unsafe since any code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app.\\nJust like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.\\nThere’s another side to this problem: you don’t want the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your program. It’s much better to have it within one class, especially if the rest of your code already depends on it.\\nNowadays, the Singleton pattern has become so popular that people may call something a\\nsingleton\\neven if it solves just one of the listed problems.\\nSolution\\nAll implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:\\nMake the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the\\nnew\\noperator with the Singleton class.\\nCreate a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.\\nIf your code has access to the Singleton class, then it’s able to call the Singleton’s static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nThe government is an excellent example of the Singleton pattern. A country can have only one official government. Regardless of the personal identities of the individuals who form governments, the title, “The Government of X”, is a global point of access that identifies the group of people in charge.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nSingleton\\nclass declares the static method\\ngetInstance\\nthat returns the same instance of its own class.\\nThe Singleton’s constructor should be hidden from the client code. Calling the\\ngetInstance\\nmethod should be the only way of getting the Singleton object.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the database connection class acts as a\\nSingleton\\n. This class doesn’t have a public constructor, so the only way to get its object is to call the\\ngetInstance\\nmethod. This method caches the first created object and returns it in all subsequent calls.\\n// The Database class defines the `getInstance` method that lets\\n// clients access the same instance of a database connection\\n// throughout the program.\\nclass Database is\\n    // The field for storing the singleton instance should be\\n    // declared static.\\n    private static field instance: Database\\n\\n    // The singleton\\'s constructor should always be private to\\n    // prevent direct construction calls with the `new`\\n    // operator.\\n    private constructor Database() is\\n        // Some initialization code, such as the actual\\n        // connection to a database server.\\n        // ...\\n\\n    // The static method that controls access to the singleton\\n    // instance.\\n    public static method getInstance() is\\n        if (Database.instance == null) then\\n            acquireThreadLock() and then\\n                // Ensure that the instance hasn\\'t yet been\\n                // initialized by another thread while this one\\n                // has been waiting for the lock\\'s release.\\n                if (Database.instance == null) then\\n                    Database.instance = new Database()\\n        return Database.instance\\n\\n    // Finally, any singleton should define some business logic\\n    // which can be executed on its instance.\\n    public method query(sql) is\\n        // For instance, all database queries of an app go\\n        // through this method. Therefore, you can place\\n        // throttling or caching logic here.\\n        // ...\\n\\nclass Application is\\n    method main() is\\n        Database foo = Database.getInstance()\\n        foo.query(\"SELECT ...\")\\n        // ...\\n        Database bar = Database.getInstance()\\n        bar.query(\"SELECT ...\")\\n        // The variable `bar` will contain the same object as\\n        // the variable `foo`.\\nApplicability\\nUse the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.\\nThe Singleton pattern disables all other means of creating objects of a class except for the special creation method. This method either creates a new object or returns an existing one if it has already been created.\\nUse the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.\\nUnlike global variables, the Singleton pattern guarantees that there’s just one instance of a class. Nothing, except for the Singleton class itself, can replace the cached instance.\\nNote that you can always adjust this limitation and allow creating any number of Singleton instances. The only piece of code that needs changing is the body of the\\ngetInstance\\nmethod.\\nHow to Implement\\nAdd a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.\\nDeclare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.\\nImplement “lazy initialization” inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls.\\nMake the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.\\nGo over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton’s constructor with calls to its static creation method.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can be sure that a class has only a single instance.\\nYou gain a global access point to that instance.\\nThe singleton object is initialized only when it’s requested for the first time.\\nViolates the\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. The pattern solves two problems at the time.\\nThe Singleton pattern can mask bad design, for instance, when the components of the program know too much about each other.\\nThe pattern requires special treatment in a multithreaded environment so that multiple threads won’t create a singleton object several times.\\nIt may be difficult to unit test the client code of the Singleton because many test frameworks rely on inheritance when producing mock objects. Since the constructor of the singleton class is private and overriding static methods is impossible in most languages, you will need to think of a creative way to mock the singleton. Or just don’t write the tests. Or don’t use the Singleton pattern.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nA\\nFacade\\nclass can often be transformed into a\\nSingleton\\nsince a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.\\nFlyweight\\nwould resemble\\nSingleton\\nif you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object. But there are two fundamental differences between these patterns:\\nThere should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a\\nFlyweight\\nclass can have multiple instances with different intrinsic states.\\nThe\\nSingleton\\nobject can be mutable. Flyweight objects are immutable.\\nAbstract Factories\\n,\\nBuilders\\nand\\nPrototypes\\ncan all be implemented as\\nSingletons\\n.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22

title:\\nAdapter\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nStructural Patterns\\nAdapter\\nAlso known as:\\nWrapper\\nIntent\\nAdapter\\nis a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to\\xa0collaborate.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.\\nAt some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.\\nYou could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not have access to the library’s source code in the first place, making this approach impossible.\\nSolution\\nYou can create an\\nadapter\\n. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.\\nAn adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles.\\nAdapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. Here’s how it works:\\nThe adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.\\nUsing this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods.\\nUpon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects.\\nSometimes it’s even possible to create a two-way adapter that can convert the calls in both directions.\\nLet’s get back to our stock market app. To solve the dilemma of incompatible formats, you can create XML-to-JSON adapters for every class of the analytics library that your code works with directly. Then you adjust your code to communicate with the library only via these adapters. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming XML data into a JSON structure and passes the call to the appropriate methods of a wrapped analytics object.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nA suitcase before and after a trip\\xa0abroad.\\nWhen you travel from the US to Europe for the first time, you may get a surprise when trying to charge your laptop. The power plug and sockets standards are different in different countries. That’s why your US plug won’t fit a German socket. The problem can be solved by using a power plug adapter that has the American-style socket and the European-style plug.\\nStructure\\nObject adapter\\nThis implementation uses the object composition principle: the adapter implements the interface of one object and wraps the other one. It can be implemented in all popular programming languages.\\nThe\\nClient\\nis a class that contains the existing business logic of the program.\\nThe\\nClient Interface\\ndescribes a protocol that other classes must follow to be able to collaborate with the client code.\\nThe\\nService\\nis some useful class (usually 3rd-party or legacy). The client can’t use this class directly because it has an incompatible interface.\\nThe\\nAdapter\\nis a class that’s able to work with both the client and the service: it implements the client interface, while wrapping the service object. The adapter receives calls from the client via the client interface and translates them into calls to the wrapped service object in a format it can understand.\\nThe client code doesn’t get coupled to the concrete adapter class as long as it works with the adapter via the client interface. Thanks to this, you can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code. This can be useful when the interface of the service class gets changed or replaced: you can just create a new adapter class without changing the client code.\\nClass adapter\\nThis implementation uses inheritance: the adapter inherits interfaces from both objects at the same time. Note that this approach can only be implemented in programming languages that support multiple inheritance, such as C++.\\nThe\\nClass Adapter\\ndoesn’t need to wrap any objects because it inherits behaviors from both the client and the service. The adaptation happens within the overridden methods. The resulting adapter can be used in place of an existing client class.\\nPseudocode\\nThis example of the\\nAdapter\\npattern is based on the classic conflict between square pegs and round holes.\\nAdapting square pegs to round\\xa0holes.\\nThe Adapter pretends to be a round peg, with a radius equal to a half of the square’s diameter (in other words, the radius of the smallest circle that can accommodate the square peg).\\n// Say you have two classes with compatible interfaces:\\n// RoundHole and RoundPeg.\\nclass RoundHole is\\n    constructor RoundHole(radius) { ... }\\n\\n    method getRadius() is\\n        // Return the radius of the hole.\\n\\n    method fits(peg: RoundPeg) is\\n        return this.getRadius() >= peg.getRadius()\\n\\nclass RoundPeg is\\n    constructor RoundPeg(radius) { ... }\\n\\n    method getRadius() is\\n        // Return the radius of the peg.\\n\\n\\n// But there\\'s an incompatible class: SquarePeg.\\nclass SquarePeg is\\n    constructor SquarePeg(width) { ... }\\n\\n    method getWidth() is\\n        // Return the square peg width.\\n\\n\\n// An adapter class lets you fit square pegs into round holes.\\n// It extends the RoundPeg class to let the adapter objects act\\n// as round pegs.\\nclass SquarePegAdapter extends RoundPeg is\\n    // In reality, the adapter contains an instance of the\\n    // SquarePeg class.\\n    private field peg: SquarePeg\\n\\n    constructor SquarePegAdapter(peg: SquarePeg) is\\n        this.peg = peg\\n\\n    method getRadius() is\\n        // The adapter pretends that it\\'s a round peg with a\\n        // radius that could fit the square peg that the adapter\\n        // actually wraps.\\n        return peg.getWidth() * Math.sqrt(2) / 2\\n\\n\\n// Somewhere in client code.\\nhole = new RoundHole(5)\\nrpeg = new RoundPeg(5)\\nhole.fits(rpeg) // true\\n\\nsmall_sqpeg = new SquarePeg(5)\\nlarge_sqpeg = new SquarePeg(10)\\nhole.fits(small_sqpeg) // this won\\'t compile (incompatible types)\\n\\nsmall_sqpeg_adapter = new SquarePegAdapter(small_sqpeg)\\nlarge_sqpeg_adapter = new SquarePegAdapter(large_sqpeg)\\nhole.fits(small_sqpeg_adapter) // true\\nhole.fits(large_sqpeg_adapter) // false\\nApplicability\\nUse the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isn’t compatible with the rest of your code.\\nThe Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class, a 3rd-party class or any other class with a weird interface.\\nUse the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that can’t be added to the superclass.\\nYou could extend each subclass and put the missing functionality into new child classes. However, you’ll need to duplicate the code across all of these new classes, which\\nsmells really bad\\n.\\nThe much more elegant solution would be to put the missing functionality into an adapter class. Then you would wrap objects with missing features inside the adapter, gaining needed features dynamically. For this to work, the target classes must have a common interface, and the adapter’s field should follow that interface. This approach looks very similar to the\\nDecorator\\npattern.\\nHow to Implement\\nMake sure that you have at least two classes with incompatible interfaces:\\nA useful\\nservice\\nclass, which you can’t change (often 3rd-party, legacy or with lots of existing dependencies).\\nOne or several\\nclient\\nclasses that would benefit from using the service class.\\nDeclare the client interface and describe how clients communicate with the service.\\nCreate the adapter class and make it follow the client interface. Leave all the methods empty for now.\\nAdd a field to the adapter class to store a reference to the service object. The common practice is to initialize this field via the constructor, but sometimes it’s more convenient to pass it to the adapter when calling its methods.\\nOne by one, implement all methods of the client interface in the adapter class. The adapter should delegate most of the real work to the service object, handling only the interface or data format conversion.\\nClients should use the adapter via the client interface. This will let you change or extend the adapters without affecting the client code.\\nPros and Cons\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code, as long as they work with the adapters through the client interface.\\nThe overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes it’s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nBridge\\nis usually designed up-front, letting you develop parts of an application independently of each other. On the other hand,\\nAdapter\\nis commonly used with an existing app to make some otherwise-incompatible classes work together nicely.\\nAdapter\\nprovides a completely different interface for accessing an existing object. On the other hand, with the\\nDecorator\\npattern the interface either stays the same or gets extended. In addition,\\nDecorator\\nsupports recursive composition, which isn’t possible when you use\\nAdapter\\n.\\nWith\\nAdapter\\nyou access an existing object via different interface. With\\nProxy\\n, the interface stays the same. With\\nDecorator\\nyou access the object via an enhanced interface.\\nFacade\\ndefines a new interface for existing objects, whereas\\nAdapter\\ntries to make the existing interface usable.\\nAdapter\\nusually wraps just one object, while\\nFacade\\nworks with an entire subsystem of objects.\\nBridge\\n,\\nState\\n,\\nStrategy\\n(and to some degree\\nAdapter\\n) have very similar structures. Indeed, all of these patterns are based on composition, which is delegating work to other objects. However, they all solve different problems. A pattern isn’t just a recipe for structuring your code in a specific way. It can also communicate to other developers the problem the pattern solves.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained in depth.\\n409 well-structured, easy to read, jargon-free pages.\\n225 clear and helpful illustrations and diagrams.\\nAn archive with code examples in 11 languages.\\nAll devices supported: PDF/EPUB/MOBI/KFX formats.\\nLearn more…\\nRead next\\nBridge\\nReturn\\nStructural Patterns\\nThis article is a part of our eBook\\nDive Into Design Patterns\\n.\\nLearn more…\\nPremium Content\\nDesign Patterns eBook\\nRefactoring Course\\nRefactoring\\nWhat is Refactoring\\nClean code\\nTechnical debt\\nWhen to refactor\\nHow to refactor\\nCatalog\\nCode Smells\\nBloaters\\nLong Method\\nLarge Class\\nPrimitive Obsession\\nLong Parameter List\\nData Clumps\\nObject-Orientation Abusers\\nSwitch Statements\\nTemporary Field\\nRefused Bequest\\nAlternative Classes with Different Interfaces\\nChange Preventers\\nDivergent Change\\nShotgun Surgery\\nParallel Inheritance Hierarchies\\nDispensables\\nComments\\nDuplicate Code\\nLazy Class\\nData Class\\nDead Code\\nSpeculative Generality\\nCouplers\\nFeature Envy\\nInappropriate Intimacy\\nMessage Chains\\nMiddle Man\\nOther Smells\\nIncomplete Library Class\\nRefactorings\\nComposing Methods\\nExtract Method\\nInline Method\\nExtract Variable\\nInline Temp\\nReplace Temp with Query\\nSplit Temporary Variable\\nRemove Assignments to Parameters\\nReplace Method with Method Object\\nSubstitute Algorithm\\nMoving Features between Objects\\nMove Method\\nMove Field\\nExtract Class\\nInline Class\\nHide Delegate\\nRemove Middle Man\\nIntroduce Foreign Method\\nIntroduce Local Extension\\nOrganizing Data\\nSelf Encapsulate Field\\nReplace Data Value with Object\\nChange Value to Reference\\nChange Reference to Value\\nReplace Array with Object\\nDuplicate Observed Data\\nChange Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional\\nChange Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional\\nReplace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant\\nEncapsulate Field\\nEncapsulate Collection\\nReplace Type Code with Class\\nReplace Type Code with Subclasses\\nReplace Type Code with State/Strategy\\nReplace Subclass with Fields\\nSimplifying Conditional Expressions\\nDecompose Conditional\\nConsolidate Conditional Expression\\nConsolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments\\nRemove Control Flag\\nReplace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses\\nReplace Conditional with Polymorphism\\nIntroduce Null Object\\nIntroduce Assertion\\nSimplifying Method Calls\\nRename Method\\nAdd Parameter\\nRemove Parameter\\nSeparate Query from Modifier\\nParameterize Method\\nReplace Parameter with Explicit Methods\\nPreserve Whole Object\\nReplace Parameter with Method Call\\nIntroduce Parameter Object\\nRemove Setting Method\\nHide Method\\nReplace Constructor with Factory Method\\nReplace Error Code with Exception\\nReplace Exception with Test\\nDealing with Generalization\\nPull Up Field\\nPull Up Method\\nPull Up Constructor Body\\nPush Down Method\\nPush Down Field\\nExtract Subclass\\nExtract Superclass\\nExtract Interface\\nCollapse Hierarchy\\nForm Template Method\\nReplace Inheritance with Delegation\\nReplace Delegation with Inheritance\\nDesign Patterns\\nWhat is a Pattern\\nWhat\\'s a design pattern?\\nHistory of patterns\\nWhy should I learn patterns?\\nCriticism of patterns\\nClassification of patterns\\nCatalog\\nCreational Patterns\\nFactory Method\\nAbstract Factory\\nBuilder\\nPrototype\\nSingleton\\nStructural Patterns\\nAdapter\\nBridge\\nComposite\\nDecorator\\nFacade\\nFlyweight\\nProxy\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\nCommand\\nIterator\\nMediator\\nMemento\\nObserver\\nState\\nStrategy\\nTemplate Method\\nVisitor\\nCode Examples\\nC#\\nC++\\nGo\\nJava\\nPHP\\nPython\\nRuby\\nRust\\nSwift\\nTypeScript\\nSign in\\nContact us\\nShop Now!\\nEnglish\\nEnglish\\nEspañol\\nFrançais\\n日本語\\n한국어\\nPolski\\nPortuguês Brasileiro\\nРусский\\nУкраїнська\\n中文\\nContact us\\nSign in\\nHome\\nRefactoring\\nDesign Patterns\\nPremium Content\\nForum\\nContact us\\n2014-2025\\nRefactoring.Guru\\n.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nIllustrations by\\nDmitry Zhart\\nTerms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nContent Usage Policy\\nAbout us\\nUkrainian office:\\nFOP Olga Skobeleva\\nAbolmasova 7\\nKyiv, Ukraine, 02002\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\nSpanish office:\\nOleksandr Shvets\\nAvda Pamplona 64\\nPamplona, Spain, 31009\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\n\\nBridge\\n\\nWebpage title:\\nBridge\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nStructural Patterns\\nBridge\\nIntent\\nBridge\\nis a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each\\xa0other.\\nProblem\\nAbstraction?\\nImplementation?\\nSound scary? Stay calm and let’s consider a simple example.\\nSay you have a geometric\\nShape\\nclass with a pair of subclasses:\\nCircle\\nand\\nSquare\\n. You want to extend this class hierarchy to incorporate colors, so you plan to create\\nRed\\nand\\nBlue\\nshape subclasses. However, since you already have two subclasses, you’ll need to create four class combinations such as\\nBlueCircle\\nand\\nRedSquare\\n.\\nAdding new shape types and colors to the hierarchy will grow it exponentially. For example, to add a triangle shape you’d need to introduce two subclasses, one for each color. And after that, adding a new color would require creating three subclasses, one for each shape type. The further we go, the worse it becomes.\\nSolution\\nThis problem occurs because we’re trying to extend the shape classes in two independent dimensions: by form and by color. That’s a very common issue with class inheritance.\\nThe Bridge pattern attempts to solve this problem by switching from inheritance to the object composition. What this means is that you extract one of the dimensions into a separate class hierarchy, so that the original classes will reference an object of the new hierarchy, instead of having all of its state and behaviors within one class.\\nYou can prevent the explosion of a class hierarchy by transforming it into several related\\xa0hierarchies.\\nFollowing this approach, we can extract the color-related code into its own class with two subclasses:\\nRed\\nand\\nBlue\\n. The\\nShape\\nclass then gets a reference field pointing to one of the color objects. Now the shape can delegate any color-related work to the linked color object. That reference will act as a bridge between the\\nShape\\nand\\nColor\\nclasses. From now on, adding new colors won’t require changing the shape hierarchy, and vice versa.\\nAbstraction and Implementation\\nThe GoF book\\n“Gang of Four” is a nickname given to the four authors of the original book about design patterns:\\nDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\\nhttps://refactoring.guru/gof-book\\n.\\nintroduces the terms\\nAbstraction\\nand\\nImplementation\\nas part of the Bridge definition. In my opinion, the terms sound too academic and make the pattern seem more complicated than it really is. Having read the simple example with shapes and colors, let’s decipher the meaning behind the GoF book’s scary words.\\nAbstraction\\n(also called\\ninterface\\n) is a high-level control layer for some entity. This layer isn’t supposed to do any real work on its own. It should delegate the work to the\\nimplementation\\nlayer (also called\\nplatform\\n).\\nNote that we’re not talking about\\ninterfaces\\nor\\nabstract classes\\nfrom your programming language. These aren’t the same things.\\nWhen talking about real applications, the abstraction can be represented by a graphical user interface (GUI), and the implementation could be the underlying operating system code (API) which the GUI layer calls in response to user interactions.\\nGenerally speaking, you can extend such an app in two independent directions:\\nHave several different GUIs (for instance, tailored for regular customers or admins).\\nSupport several different APIs (for example, to be able to launch the app under Windows, Linux, and macOS).\\nIn a worst-case scenario, this app might look like a giant spaghetti bowl, where hundreds of conditionals connect different types of GUI with various APIs all over the code.\\nMaking even a simple change to a monolithic codebase is pretty hard because you must understand the\\nentire thing\\nvery well. Making changes to smaller, well-defined modules is much\\xa0easier.\\nYou can bring order to this chaos by extracting the code related to specific interface-platform combinations into separate classes. However, soon you’ll discover that there are\\nlots\\nof these classes. The class hierarchy will grow exponentially because adding a new GUI or supporting a different API would require creating more and more classes.\\nLet’s try to solve this issue with the Bridge pattern. It suggests that we divide the classes into two hierarchies:\\nAbstraction: the GUI layer of the app.\\nImplementation: the operating systems’ APIs.\\nOne of the ways to structure a cross-platform\\xa0application.\\nThe abstraction object controls the appearance of the app, delegating the actual work to the linked implementation object. Different implementations are interchangeable as long as they follow a common interface, enabling the same GUI to work under Windows and Linux.\\nAs a result, you can change the GUI classes without touching the API-related classes. Moreover, adding support for another operating system only requires creating a subclass in the implementation hierarchy.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nAbstraction\\nprovides high-level control logic. It relies on the implementation object to do the actual low-level work.\\nThe\\nImplementation\\ndeclares the interface that’s common for all concrete implementations. An abstraction can only communicate with an implementation object via methods that are declared here.\\nThe abstraction may list the same methods as the implementation, but usually the abstraction declares some complex behaviors that rely on a wide variety of primitive operations declared by the implementation.\\nConcrete Implementations\\ncontain platform-specific code.\\nRefined Abstractions\\nprovide variants of control logic. Like their parent, they work with different implementations via the general implementation interface.\\nUsually, the\\nClient\\nis only interested in working with the abstraction. However, it’s the client’s job to link the abstraction object with one of the implementation objects.\\nPseudocode\\nThis example illustrates how the\\nBridge\\npattern can help divide the monolithic code of an app that manages devices and their remote controls. The\\nDevice\\nclasses act as the implementation, whereas the\\nRemote\\ns act as the abstraction.\\nThe original class hierarchy is divided into two parts: devices and remote\\xa0controls.\\nThe base remote control class declares a reference field that links it with a device object. All remotes work with the devices via the general device interface, which lets the same remote support multiple device types.\\nYou can develop the remote control classes independently from the device classes. All that’s needed is to create a new remote subclass. For example, a basic remote control might only have two buttons, but you could extend it with additional features, such as an extra battery or a touchscreen.\\nThe client code links the desired type of remote control with a specific device object via the remote’s constructor.\\n// The \"abstraction\" defines the interface for the \"control\"\\n// part of the two class hierarchies. It maintains a reference\\n// to an object of the \"implementation\" hierarchy and delegates\\n// all of the real work to this object.\\nclass RemoteControl is\\n    protected field device: Device\\n    constructor RemoteControl(device: Device) is\\n        this.device = device\\n    method togglePower() is\\n        if (device.isEnabled()) then\\n            device.disable()\\n        else\\n            device.enable()\\n    method volumeDown() is\\n        device.setVolume(device.getVolume() - 10)\\n    method volumeUp() is\\n        device.setVolume(device.getVolume() + 10)\\n    method channelDown() is\\n        device.setChannel(device.getChannel() - 1)\\n    method channelUp() is\\n        device.setChannel(device.getChannel() + 1)\\n\\n\\n// You can extend classes from the abstraction hierarchy\\n// independently from device classes.\\nclass AdvancedRemoteControl extends RemoteControl is\\n    method mute() is\\n        device.setVolume(0)\\n\\n\\n// The \"implementation\" interface declares methods common to all\\n// concrete implementation classes. It doesn\\'t have to match the\\n// abstraction\\'s interface. In fact, the two interfaces can be\\n// entirely different. Typically the implementation interface\\n// provides only primitive operations, while the abstraction\\n// defines higher-level operations based on those primitives.\\ninterface Device is\\n    method isEnabled()\\n    method enable()\\n    method disable()\\n    method getVolume()\\n    method setVolume(percent)\\n    method getChannel()\\n    method setChannel(channel)\\n\\n\\n// All devices follow the same interface.\\nclass Tv implements Device is\\n    // ...\\n\\nclass Radio implements Device is\\n    // ...\\n\\n\\n// Somewhere in client code.\\ntv = new Tv()\\nremote = new RemoteControl(tv)\\nremote.togglePower()\\n\\nradio = new Radio()\\nremote = new AdvancedRemoteControl(radio)\\nApplicability\\nUse the Bridge pattern when you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality (for example, if the class can work with various database servers).\\nThe bigger a class becomes, the harder it is to figure out how it works, and the longer it takes to make a change. The changes made to one of the variations of functionality may require making changes across the whole class, which often results in making errors or not addressing some critical side effects.\\nThe Bridge pattern lets you split the monolithic class into several class hierarchies. After this, you can change the classes in each hierarchy independently of the classes in the others. This approach simplifies code maintenance and minimizes the risk of breaking existing code.\\nUse the pattern when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.\\nThe Bridge suggests that you extract a separate class hierarchy for each of the dimensions. The original class delegates the related work to the objects belonging to those hierarchies instead of doing everything on its own.\\nUse the Bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.\\nAlthough it’s optional, the Bridge pattern lets you replace the implementation object inside the abstraction. It’s as easy as assigning a new value to a field.\\nBy the way, this last item is the main reason why so many people confuse the Bridge with the\\nStrategy\\npattern. Remember that a pattern is more than just a certain way to structure your classes. It may also communicate intent and a problem being addressed.\\nHow to Implement\\nIdentify the orthogonal dimensions in your classes. These independent concepts could be: abstraction/platform, domain/infrastructure, front-end/back-end, or interface/implementation.\\nSee what operations the client needs and define them in the base abstraction class.\\nDetermine the operations available on all platforms. Declare the ones that the abstraction needs in the general implementation interface.\\nFor all platforms in your domain create concrete implementation classes, but make sure they all follow the implementation interface.\\nInside the abstraction class, add a reference field for the implementation type. The abstraction delegates most of the work to the implementation object that’s referenced in that field.\\nIf you have several variants of high-level logic, create refined abstractions for each variant by extending the base abstraction class.\\nThe client code should pass an implementation object to the abstraction’s constructor to associate one with the other. After that, the client can forget about the implementation and work only with the abstraction object.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can create platform-independent classes and apps.\\nThe client code works with high-level abstractions. It isn’t exposed to the platform details.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new abstractions and implementations independently from each other.\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction and on platform details in the implementation.\\nYou might make the code more complicated by applying the pattern to a highly cohesive class.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nBridge\\nis usually designed up-front, letting you develop parts of an application independently of each other. On the other hand,\\nAdapter\\nis commonly used with an existing app to make some otherwise-incompatible classes work together nicely.\\nBridge\\n,\\nState\\n,\\nStrategy\\n(and to some degree\\nAdapter\\n) have very similar structures. Indeed, all of these patterns are based on composition, which is delegating work to other objects. However, they all solve different problems. A pattern isn’t just a recipe for structuring your code in a specific way. It can also communicate to other developers the problem the pattern solves.\\nYou can use\\nAbstract Factory\\nalong with\\nBridge\\n. This pairing is useful when some abstractions defined by\\nBridge\\ncan only work with specific implementations. In this case,\\nAbstract Factory\\ncan encapsulate these relations and hide the complexity from the client code.\\nYou can combine\\nBuilder\\nwith\\nBridge\\n: the director class plays the role of the abstraction, while different builders act as implementations.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained in depth.\\n409

title:\\nComposite\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nStructural Patterns\\nComposite\\nAlso known as:\\nObject Tree\\nIntent\\nComposite\\nis a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual\\xa0objects.\\nProblem\\nUsing the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.\\nFor example, imagine that you have two types of objects:\\nProducts\\nand\\nBoxes\\n. A\\nBox\\ncan contain several\\nProducts\\nas well as a number of smaller\\nBoxes\\n. These little\\nBoxes\\ncan also hold some\\nProducts\\nor even smaller\\nBoxes\\n, and so on.\\nSay you decide to create an ordering system that uses these classes. Orders could contain simple products without any wrapping, as well as boxes stuffed with products...and other boxes. How would you determine the total price of such an order?\\nYou could try the direct approach: unwrap all the boxes, go over all the products and then calculate the total. That would be doable in the real world; but in a program, it’s not as simple as running a loop. You have to know the classes of\\nProducts\\nand\\nBoxes\\nyou’re going through, the nesting level of the boxes and other nasty details beforehand. All of this makes the direct approach either too awkward or even impossible.\\nSolution\\nThe Composite pattern suggests that you work with\\nProducts\\nand\\nBoxes\\nthrough a common interface which declares a method for calculating the total price.\\nHow would this method work? For a product, it’d simply return the product’s price. For a box, it’d go over each item the box contains, ask its price and then return a total for this box. If one of these items were a smaller box, that box would also start going over its contents and so on, until the prices of all inner components were calculated. A box could even add some extra cost to the final price, such as packaging cost.\\nThe Composite pattern lets you run a behavior recursively over all components of an object\\xa0tree.\\nThe greatest benefit of this approach is that you don’t need to care about the concrete classes of objects that compose the tree. You don’t need to know whether an object is a simple product or a sophisticated box. You can treat them all the same via the common interface. When you call a method, the objects themselves pass the request down the tree.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nAn example of a military\\xa0structure.\\nArmies of most countries are structured as hierarchies. An army consists of several divisions; a division is a set of brigades, and a brigade consists of platoons, which can be broken down into squads. Finally, a squad is a small group of real soldiers. Orders are given at the top of the hierarchy and passed down onto each level until every soldier knows what needs to be done.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nComponent\\ninterface describes operations that are common to both simple and complex elements of the tree.\\nThe\\nLeaf\\nis a basic element of a tree that doesn’t have sub-elements.\\nUsually, leaf components end up doing most of the real work, since they don’t have anyone to delegate the work to.\\nThe\\nContainer\\n(aka\\ncomposite\\n) is an element that has sub-elements: leaves or other containers. A container doesn’t know the concrete classes of its children. It works with all sub-elements only via the component interface.\\nUpon receiving a request, a container delegates the work to its sub-elements, processes intermediate results and then returns the final result to the client.\\nThe\\nClient\\nworks with all elements through the component interface. As a result, the client can work in the same way with both simple or complex elements of the tree.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nComposite\\npattern lets you implement stacking of geometric shapes in a graphical editor.\\nThe geometric shapes editor\\xa0example.\\nThe\\nCompoundGraphic\\nclass is a container that can comprise any number of sub-shapes, including other compound shapes. A compound shape has the same methods as a simple shape. However, instead of doing something on its own, a compound shape passes the request recursively to all its children and “sums up” the result.\\nThe client code works with all shapes through the single interface common to all shape classes. Thus, the client doesn’t know whether it’s working with a simple shape or a compound one. The client can work with very complex object structures without being coupled to concrete classes that form that structure.\\n// The component interface declares common operations for both\\n// simple and complex objects of a composition.\\ninterface Graphic is\\n    method move(x, y)\\n    method draw()\\n\\n// The leaf class represents end objects of a composition. A\\n// leaf object can\\'t have any sub-objects. Usually, it\\'s leaf\\n// objects that do the actual work, while composite objects only\\n// delegate to their sub-components.\\nclass Dot implements Graphic is\\n    field x, y\\n\\n    constructor Dot(x, y) { ... }\\n\\n    method move(x, y) is\\n        this.x += x, this.y += y\\n\\n    method draw() is\\n        // Draw a dot at X and Y.\\n\\n// All component classes can extend other components.\\nclass Circle extends Dot is\\n    field radius\\n\\n    constructor Circle(x, y, radius) { ... }\\n\\n    method draw() is\\n        // Draw a circle at X and Y with radius R.\\n\\n// The composite class represents complex components that may\\n// have children. Composite objects usually delegate the actual\\n// work to their children and then \"sum up\" the result.\\nclass CompoundGraphic implements Graphic is\\n    field children: array of Graphic\\n\\n    // A composite object can add or remove other components\\n    // (both simple or complex) to or from its child list.\\n    method add(child: Graphic) is\\n        // Add a child to the array of children.\\n\\n    method remove(child: Graphic) is\\n        // Remove a child from the array of children.\\n\\n    method move(x, y) is\\n        foreach (child in children) do\\n            child.move(x, y)\\n\\n    // A composite executes its primary logic in a particular\\n    // way. It traverses recursively through all its children,\\n    // collecting and summing up their results. Since the\\n    // composite\\'s children pass these calls to their own\\n    // children and so forth, the whole object tree is traversed\\n    // as a result.\\n    method draw() is\\n        // 1. For each child component:\\n        //     - Draw the component.\\n        //     - Update the bounding rectangle.\\n        // 2. Draw a dashed rectangle using the bounding\\n        // coordinates.\\n\\n\\n// The client code works with all the components via their base\\n// interface. This way the client code can support simple leaf\\n// components as well as complex composites.\\nclass ImageEditor is\\n    field all: CompoundGraphic\\n\\n    method load() is\\n        all = new CompoundGraphic()\\n        all.add(new Dot(1, 2))\\n        all.add(new Circle(5, 3, 10))\\n        // ...\\n\\n    // Combine selected components into one complex composite\\n    // component.\\n    method groupSelected(components: array of Graphic) is\\n        group = new CompoundGraphic()\\n        foreach (component in components) do\\n            group.add(component)\\n            all.remove(component)\\n        all.add(group)\\n        // All components will be drawn.\\n        all.draw()\\nApplicability\\nUse the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.\\nThe Composite pattern provides you with two basic element types that share a common interface: simple leaves and complex containers. A container can be composed of both leaves and other containers. This lets you construct a nested recursive object structure that resembles a tree.\\nUse the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.\\nAll elements defined by the Composite pattern share a common interface. Using this interface, the client doesn’t have to worry about the concrete class of the objects it works with.\\nHow to Implement\\nMake sure that the core model of your app can be represented as a tree structure. Try to break it down into simple elements and containers. Remember that containers must be able to contain both simple elements and other containers.\\nDeclare the component interface with a list of methods that make sense for both simple and complex components.\\nCreate a leaf class to represent simple elements. A program may have multiple different leaf classes.\\nCreate a container class to represent complex elements. In this class, provide an array field for storing references to sub-elements. The array must be able to store both leaves and containers, so make sure it’s declared with the component interface type.\\nWhile implementing the methods of the component interface, remember that a container is supposed to be delegating most of the work to sub-elements.\\nFinally, define the methods for adding and removal of child elements in the container.\\nKeep in mind that these operations can be declared in the component interface. This would violate the\\nInterface Segregation Principle\\nbecause the methods will be empty in the leaf class. However, the client will be able to treat all the elements equally, even when composing the tree.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new element types into the app without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree.\\nIt might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, you’d need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nYou can use\\nBuilder\\nwhen creating complex\\nComposite\\ntrees because you can program its construction steps to work recursively.\\nChain of Responsibility\\nis often used in conjunction with\\nComposite\\n. In this case, when a leaf component gets a request, it may pass it through the chain of all of the parent components down to the root of the object tree.\\nYou can use\\nIterators\\nto traverse\\nComposite\\ntrees.\\nYou can use\\nVisitor\\nto execute an operation over an entire\\nComposite\\ntree.\\nYou can implement shared leaf nodes of the\\nComposite\\ntree as\\nFlyweights\\nto save some RAM.\\nComposite\\nand\\nDecorator\\nhave similar structure diagrams since both rely on recursive composition to organize an open-ended number of objects.\\nA\\nDecorator\\nis like a\\nComposite\\nbut only has one child component. There’s another significant difference:\\nDecorator\\nadds additional responsibilities to the wrapped object, while\\nComposite\\njust “sums up” its children’s results.\\nHowever, the patterns can also cooperate: you can use\\nDecorator\\nto extend the behavior of a specific object in the\\nComposite\\ntree.\\nDesigns that make heavy use of\\nComposite\\nand\\nDecorator\\ncan often benefit from using\\nPrototype\\n. Applying the pattern lets you clone complex structures instead of re-constructing them from scratch.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles

title:\\nDecorator\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nStructural Patterns\\nDecorator\\nAlso known as:\\nWrapper\\nIntent\\nDecorator\\nis a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the\\xa0behaviors.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you’re working on a notification library which lets other programs notify their users about important events.\\nThe initial version of the library was based on the\\nNotifier\\nclass that had only a few fields, a constructor and a single\\nsend\\nmethod. The method could accept a message argument from a client and send the message to a list of emails that were passed to the notifier via its constructor. A third-party app which acted as a client was supposed to create and configure the notifier object once, and then use it each time something important happened.\\nAt some point, you realize that users of the library expect more than just email notifications. Many of them would like to receive an SMS about critical issues. Others would like to be notified on Facebook and, of course, the corporate users would love to get Slack notifications.\\nEach notification type is implemented as a notifier’s\\xa0subclass.\\nHow hard can that be? You extended the\\nNotifier\\nclass and put the additional notification methods into new subclasses. Now the client was supposed to instantiate the desired notification class and use it for all further notifications.\\nBut then someone reasonably asked you, “Why can’t you use several notification types at once? If your house is on fire, you’d probably want to be informed through every channel.”\\nYou tried to address that problem by creating special subclasses which combined several notification methods within one class. However, it quickly became apparent that this approach would bloat the code immensely, not only the library code but the client code as well.\\nCombinatorial explosion of\\xa0subclasses.\\nYou have to find some other way to structure notifications classes so that their number won’t accidentally break some Guinness record.\\nSolution\\nExtending a class is the first thing that comes to mind when you need to alter an object’s behavior. However, inheritance has several serious caveats that you need to be aware of.\\nInheritance is static. You can’t alter the behavior of an existing object at runtime. You can only replace the whole object with another one that’s created from a different subclass.\\nSubclasses can have just one parent class. In most languages, inheritance doesn’t let a class inherit behaviors of multiple classes at the same time.\\nOne of the ways to overcome these caveats is by using\\nAggregation\\nor\\nComposition\\nAggregation\\n: object A contains objects B; B can live without A.\\nComposition\\n: object A consists of objects B; A manages life cycle of B; B can’t live without A.\\ninstead of\\nInheritance\\n. Both of the alternatives work almost the same way: one object\\nhas a\\nreference to another and delegates it some work, whereas with inheritance, the object itself\\nis\\nable to do that work, inheriting the behavior from its superclass.\\nWith this new approach you can easily substitute the linked “helper” object with another, changing the behavior of the container at runtime. An object can use the behavior of various classes, having references to multiple objects and delegating them all kinds of work. Aggregation/composition is the key principle behind many design patterns, including Decorator. On that note, let’s return to the pattern discussion.\\nInheritance vs.\\xa0Aggregation\\n“Wrapper” is the alternative nickname for the Decorator pattern that clearly expresses the main idea of the pattern. A\\nwrapper\\nis an object that can be linked with some\\ntarget\\nobject. The wrapper contains the same set of methods as the target and delegates to it all requests it receives. However, the wrapper may alter the result by doing something either before or after it passes the request to the target.\\nWhen does a simple wrapper become the real decorator? As I mentioned, the wrapper implements the same interface as the wrapped object. That’s why from the client’s perspective these objects are identical. Make the wrapper’s reference field accept any object that follows that interface. This will let you cover an object in multiple wrappers, adding the combined behavior of all the wrappers to it.\\nIn our notifications example, let’s leave the simple email notification behavior inside the base\\nNotifier\\nclass, but turn all other notification methods into decorators.\\nVarious notification methods become\\xa0decorators.\\nThe client code would need to wrap a basic notifier object into a set of decorators that match the client’s preferences. The resulting objects will be structured as a stack.\\nApps might configure complex stacks of notification\\xa0decorators.\\nThe last decorator in the stack would be the object that the client actually works with. Since all decorators implement the same interface as the base notifier, the rest of the client code won’t care whether it works with the “pure” notifier object or the decorated one.\\nWe could apply the same approach to other behaviors such as formatting messages or composing the recipient list. The client can decorate the object with any custom decorators, as long as they follow the same interface as the others.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nYou get a combined effect from wearing multiple pieces of\\xa0clothing.\\nWearing clothes is an example of using decorators. When you’re cold, you wrap yourself in a sweater. If you’re still cold with a sweater, you can wear a jacket on top. If it’s raining, you can put on a raincoat. All of these garments “extend” your basic behavior but aren’t part of you, and you can easily take off any piece of clothing whenever you don’t need it.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nComponent\\ndeclares the common interface for both wrappers and wrapped objects.\\nConcrete Component\\nis a class of objects being wrapped. It defines the basic behavior, which can be altered by decorators.\\nThe\\nBase Decorator\\nclass has a field for referencing a wrapped object. The field’s type should be declared as the component interface so it can contain both concrete components and decorators. The base decorator delegates all operations to the wrapped object.\\nConcrete Decorators\\ndefine extra behaviors that can be added to components dynamically. Concrete decorators override methods of the base decorator and execute their behavior either before or after calling the parent method.\\nThe\\nClient\\ncan wrap components in multiple layers of decorators, as long as it works with all objects via the component interface.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nDecorator\\npattern lets you compress and encrypt sensitive data independently from the code that actually uses this data.\\nThe encryption and compression decorators\\xa0example.\\nThe application wraps the data source object with a pair of decorators. Both wrappers change the way the data is written to and read from the disk:\\nJust before the data is\\nwritten to disk\\n, the decorators encrypt and compress it. The original class writes the encrypted and protected data to the file without knowing about the change.\\nRight after the data is\\nread from disk\\n, it goes through the same decorators, which decompress and decode it.\\nThe decorators and the data source class implement the same interface, which makes them all interchangeable in the client code.\\n// The component interface defines operations that can be\\n// altered by decorators.\\ninterface DataSource is\\n    method writeData(data)\\n    method readData():data\\n\\n// Concrete components provide default implementations for the\\n// operations. There might be several variations of these\\n// classes in a program.\\nclass FileDataSource implements DataSource is\\n    constructor FileDataSource(filename) { ... }\\n\\n    method writeData(data) is\\n        // Write data to file.\\n\\n    method readData():data is\\n        // Read data from file.\\n\\n// The base decorator class follows the same interface as the\\n// other components. The primary purpose of this class is to\\n// define the wrapping interface for all concrete decorators.\\n// The default implementation of the wrapping code might include\\n// a field for storing a wrapped component and the means to\\n// initialize it.\\nclass DataSourceDecorator implements DataSource is\\n    protected field wrappee: DataSource\\n\\n    constructor DataSourceDecorator(source: DataSource) is\\n        wrappee = source\\n\\n    // The base decorator simply delegates all work to the\\n    // wrapped component. Extra behaviors can be added in\\n    // concrete decorators.\\n    method writeData(data) is\\n        wrappee.writeData(data)\\n\\n    // Concrete decorators may call the parent implementation of\\n    // the operation instead of calling the wrapped object\\n    // directly. This approach simplifies extension of decorator\\n    // classes.\\n    method readData():data is\\n        return wrappee.readData()\\n\\n// Concrete decorators must call methods on the wrapped object,\\n// but may add something of their own to the result.

Encrypt passed data.\\n        // 2. Pass encrypted data to the wrappee\\'s writeData\\n        // method.\\n\\n    method readData():data is\\n        // 1.

The client code can treat all these objects in the same way, since they all follow a common interface.\\nUse the pattern when it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s behavior using inheritance.\\nMany programming languages have the\\nfinal\\nkeyword that can be used to prevent further extension of a class. For a final class, the only way to reuse the existing behavior would be to wrap the class with your own wrapper, using the Decorator pattern.\\nHow to Implement\\nMake sure your business domain can be represented as a primary component with multiple optional layers over it.\\nFigure out what methods are common to both the primary component and the optional layers. Create a component interface and declare those methods there.\\nCreate a concrete component class and define the base behavior in it.\\nCreate a base decorator class. It should have a field for storing a reference to a wrapped object. The field should be declared with the component interface type to allow linking to concrete components as well as decorators. The base decorator must delegate all work to the wrapped object.\\nMake sure all classes implement the component interface.\\nCreate concrete decorators by extending them from the base decorator. A concrete decorator must execute its behavior before or after the call to the parent method (which always delegates to the wrapped object).\\nThe client code must be responsible for creating decorators and composing them in the way the client needs.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can extend an object’s behavior without making a new subclass.\\nYou can add or remove responsibilities from an object at runtime.\\nYou can combine several behaviors by wrapping an object into multiple decorators.\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can divide a monolithic class that implements many possible variants of behavior into several smaller classes.\\nIt’s hard to remove a specific wrapper from the wrappers stack.\\nIt’s hard to implement a decorator in such a way that its behavior doesn’t depend on the order in the decorators stack.\\nThe initial configuration code of layers might look pretty ugly.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nAdapter\\nprovides a completely different interface for accessing an existing object. On the other hand, with the\\nDecorator\\npattern the interface either stays the same or gets extended. In addition,\\nDecorator\\nsupports recursive composition, which isn’t possible when you use\\nAdapter\\n.\\nWith\\nAdapter\\nyou access an existing object via different interface. With\\nProxy\\n, the interface stays the same. With\\nDecorator\\nyou access the object via an enhanced interface.\\nChain of Responsibility\\nand\\nDecorator\\nhave very similar class structures. Both patterns rely on recursive composition to pass the execution through a series of objects. However, there are several crucial differences.\\nThe\\nCoR\\nhandlers can execute arbitrary operations independently of each other. They can also stop passing the request further at any point. On the other hand, various\\nDecorators\\ncan extend the object’s behavior while keeping it consistent with the base interface. In addition, decorators aren’t allowed to break the flow of the request.\\nComposite\\nand\\nDecorator\\nhave similar structure diagrams since both rely on recursive composition to organize an open-ended number of objects.\\nA\\nDecorator\\nis like a\\nComposite\\nbut only has one child component. There’s another significant difference:\\nDecorator\\nadds additional responsibilities to the wrapped object, while\\nComposite\\njust “sums up” its children’s results.\\nHowever, the patterns can also cooperate: you can use\\nDecorator\\nto extend the behavior of a specific object in the\\nComposite\\ntree.\\nDesigns that make heavy use of\\nComposite\\nand\\nDecorator\\ncan often benefit from using\\nPrototype\\n. Applying the pattern lets you clone complex structures instead of re-constructing them from scratch.\\nDecorator\\nlets you change the skin of an object, while\\nStrategy\\nlets you change the guts.\\nDecorator\\nand\\nProxy\\nhave similar structures, but very different intents. Both patterns are built on the composition principle, where one object is supposed to delegate some of the work to another. The difference is that a\\nProxy\\nusually manages the life cycle of its service object on its own, whereas the composition of\\nDecorators\\nis always controlled by the client.\\nCode

title:\\nFacade\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nStructural Patterns\\nFacade\\nIntent\\nFacade\\nis a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of\\xa0classes.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework. Ordinarily, you’d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on.\\nAs a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the implementation details of 3rd-party classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain.\\nSolution\\nA facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.\\nHaving a facade is handy when you need to integrate your app with a sophisticated library that has dozens of features, but you just need a tiny bit of its functionality.\\nFor instance, an app that uploads short funny videos with cats to social media could potentially use a professional video conversion library. However, all that it really needs is a class with the single method\\nencode(filename, format)\\n. After creating such a class and connecting it with the video conversion library, you’ll have your first facade.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nWhen you call a shop to place a phone order, an operator is your facade to all services and departments of the shop. The operator provides you with a simple voice interface to the ordering system, payment gateways, and various delivery services.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nFacade\\nprovides convenient access to a particular part of the subsystem’s functionality. It knows where to direct the client’s request and how to operate all the moving parts.\\nAn\\nAdditional Facade\\nclass can be created to prevent polluting a single facade with unrelated features that might make it yet another complex structure. Additional facades can be used by both clients and other facades.\\nThe\\nComplex Subsystem\\nconsists of dozens of various objects. To make them all do something meaningful, you have to dive deep into the subsystem’s implementation details, such as initializing objects in the correct order and supplying them with data in the proper format.\\nSubsystem classes aren’t aware of the facade’s existence. They operate within the system and work with each other directly.\\nThe\\nClient\\nuses the facade instead of calling the subsystem objects directly.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nFacade\\npattern simplifies interaction with a complex video conversion framework.\\nAn example of isolating multiple dependencies within a single facade\\xa0class.\\nInstead of making your code work with dozens of the framework classes directly, you create a facade class which encapsulates that functionality and hides it from the rest of the code. This structure also helps you to minimize the effort of upgrading to future versions of the framework or replacing it with another one. The only thing you’d need to change in your app would be the implementation of the facade’s methods.\\n// These are some of the classes of a complex 3rd-party video\\n// conversion framework. We don\\'t control that code, therefore\\n// can\\'t simplify it.\\n\\nclass VideoFile\\n// ...\\n\\nclass OggCompressionCodec\\n// ...\\n\\nclass MPEG4CompressionCodec\\n// ...\\n\\nclass CodecFactory\\n// ...\\n\\nclass BitrateReader\\n// ...\\n\\nclass AudioMixer\\n// ...\\n\\n\\n// We create a facade class to hide the framework\\'s complexity\\n// behind a simple interface. It\\'s a trade-off between\\n// functionality and simplicity.\\nclass VideoConverter is\\n    method convert(filename, format):File is\\n        file = new VideoFile(filename)\\n        sourceCodec = (new CodecFactory).extract(file)\\n        if (format == \"mp4\")\\n            destinationCodec = new MPEG4CompressionCodec()\\n        else\\n            destinationCodec = new OggCompressionCodec()\\n        buffer = BitrateReader.read(filename, sourceCodec)\\n        result = BitrateReader.convert(buffer, destinationCodec)\\n        result = (new AudioMixer()).fix(result)\\n        return new File(result)\\n\\n// Application classes don\\'t depend on a billion classes\\n// provided by the complex framework. Also, if you decide to\\n// switch frameworks, you only need to rewrite the facade class.\\nclass Application is\\n    method main() is\\n        convertor = new VideoConverter()\\n        mp4 = convertor.convert(\"funny-cats-video.ogg\", \"mp4\")\\n        mp4.save()\\nApplicability\\nUse the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.\\nOften, subsystems get more complex over time. Even applying design patterns typically leads to creating more classes. A subsystem may become more flexible and easier to reuse in various contexts, but the amount of configuration and boilerplate code it demands from a client grows ever larger. The Facade attempts to fix this problem by providing a shortcut to the most-used features of the subsystem which fit most client requirements.\\nUse the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.\\nCreate facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem. You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades.\\nFor example, let’s return to our video conversion framework. It can be broken down into two layers: video- and audio-related. For each layer, you can create a facade and then make the classes of each layer communicate with each other via those facades. This approach looks very similar to the\\nMediator\\npattern.\\nHow to Implement\\nCheck whether it’s possible to provide a simpler interface than what an existing subsystem already provides. You’re on the right track if this interface makes the client code independent from many of the subsystem’s classes.\\nDeclare and implement this interface in a new facade class. The facade should redirect the calls from the client code to appropriate objects of the subsystem. The facade should be responsible for initializing the subsystem and managing its further life cycle unless the client code already does this.\\nTo get the full benefit from the pattern, make all the client code communicate with the subsystem only via the facade. Now the client code is protected from any changes in the subsystem code. For example, when a subsystem gets upgraded to a new version, you will only need to modify the code in the facade.\\nIf the facade becomes\\ntoo big\\n, consider extracting part of its behavior to a new, refined facade class.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.\\nA facade can become\\na god object\\ncoupled to all classes of an app.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nFacade\\ndefines a new interface for existing objects, whereas\\nAdapter\\ntries to make the existing interface usable.\\nAdapter\\nusually wraps just one object, while\\nFacade\\nworks with an entire subsystem of objects.\\nAbstract Factory\\ncan serve as an alternative to\\nFacade\\nwhen you only want to hide the way the subsystem objects are created from the client code.\\nFlyweight\\nshows how to make lots of little objects, whereas\\nFacade\\nshows how to make a single object that represents an entire subsystem.\\nFacade\\nand\\nMediator\\nhave similar jobs: they try to organize collaboration between lots of tightly coupled classes.\\nFacade\\ndefines a simplified interface to a subsystem of objects, but it doesn’t introduce any new functionality. The subsystem itself is unaware of the facade. Objects within the subsystem can communicate directly.\\nMediator\\ncentralizes communication between components of the system. The components only know about the mediator object and don’t communicate directly.\\nA\\nFacade\\nclass can often be transformed into a\\nSingleton\\nsince a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.\\nFacade\\nis similar to\\nProxy\\nin that both buffer a complex entity and initialize it on its own. Unlike\\nFacade\\n,\\nProxy\\nhas the same interface as its service object, which makes them interchangeable.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8

title:\\nFlyweight\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nStructural Patterns\\nFlyweight\\nAlso known as:\\nCache\\nIntent\\nFlyweight\\nis a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each\\xa0object.\\nProblem\\nTo have some fun after long working hours, you decided to create a simple video game: players would be moving around a map and shooting each other. You chose to implement a realistic particle system and make it a distinctive feature of the game. Vast quantities of bullets, missiles, and shrapnel from explosions should fly all over the map and deliver a thrilling experience to the player.\\nUpon its completion, you pushed the last commit, built the game and sent it to your friend for a test drive. Although the game was running flawlessly on your machine, your friend wasn’t able to play for long. On his computer, the game kept crashing after a few minutes of gameplay. After spending several hours digging through debug logs, you discovered that the game crashed because of an insufficient amount of RAM. It turned out that your friend’s rig was much less powerful than your own computer, and that’s why the problem emerged so quickly on his machine.\\nThe actual problem was related to your particle system. Each particle, such as a bullet, a missile or a piece of shrapnel was represented by a separate object containing plenty of data. At some point, when the carnage on a player’s screen reached its climax, newly created particles no longer fit into the remaining RAM, so the program crashed.\\nSolution\\nOn closer inspection of the\\nParticle\\nclass, you may notice that the color and\\nsprite\\nfields consume a lot more memory than other fields. What’s worse is that these two fields store almost identical data across all particles. For example, all bullets have the same color and sprite.\\nOther parts of a particle’s state, such as coordinates, movement vector and speed, are unique to each particle. After all, the values of these fields change over time. This data represents the always changing context in which the particle exists, while the color and sprite remain constant for each particle.\\nThis constant data of an object is usually called the\\nintrinsic state\\n. It lives within the object; other objects can only read it, not change it. The rest of the object’s state, often altered “from the outside” by other objects, is called the\\nextrinsic state\\n.\\nThe Flyweight pattern suggests that you stop storing the extrinsic state inside the object. Instead, you should pass this state to specific methods which rely on it. Only the intrinsic state stays within the object, letting you reuse it in different contexts. As a result, you’d need fewer of these objects since they only differ in the intrinsic state, which has much fewer variations than the extrinsic.\\nLet’s return to our game. Assuming that we had extracted the extrinsic state from our particle class, only three different objects would suffice to represent all particles in the game: a bullet, a missile, and a piece of shrapnel. As you’ve probably guessed by now, an object that only stores the intrinsic state is called\\na flyweight\\n.\\nExtrinsic state storage\\nWhere does the extrinsic state move to? Some class should still store it, right? In most cases, it gets moved to the container object, which aggregates objects before we apply the pattern.\\nIn our case, that’s the main\\nGame\\nobject that stores all particles in the\\nparticles\\nfield. To move the extrinsic state into this class, you need to create several array fields for storing coordinates, vectors, and speed of each individual particle. But that’s not all. You need another array for storing references to a specific flyweight that represents a particle. These arrays must be in sync so that you can access all data of a particle using the same index.\\nA more elegant solution is to create a separate context class that would store the extrinsic state along with reference to the flyweight object. This approach would require having just a single array in the container class.\\nWait a second! Won’t we need to have as many of these contextual objects as we had at the very beginning? Technically, yes. But the thing is, these objects are much smaller than before. The most memory-consuming fields have been moved to just a few flyweight objects. Now, a thousand small contextual objects can reuse a single heavy flyweight object instead of storing a thousand copies of its data.\\nFlyweight and immutability\\nSince the same flyweight object can be used in different contexts, you have to make sure that its state can’t be modified. A flyweight should initialize its state just once, via constructor parameters. It shouldn’t expose any setters or public fields to other objects.\\nFlyweight factory\\nFor more convenient access to various flyweights, you can create a factory method that manages a pool of existing flyweight objects. The method accepts the intrinsic state of the desired flyweight from a client, looks for an existing flyweight object matching this state, and returns it if it was found. If not, it creates a new flyweight and adds it to the pool.\\nThere are several options where this method could be placed. The most obvious place is a flyweight container. Alternatively, you could create a new factory class. Or you could make the factory method static and put it inside an actual flyweight class.\\nStructure\\nThe Flyweight pattern is merely an optimization. Before applying it, make sure your program does have the RAM consumption problem related to having a massive number of similar objects in memory at the same time. Make sure that this problem can’t be solved in any other meaningful way.\\nThe\\nFlyweight\\nclass contains the portion of the original object’s state that can be shared between multiple objects. The same flyweight object can be used in many different contexts. The state stored inside a flyweight is called\\nintrinsic.\\nThe state passed to the flyweight’s methods is called\\nextrinsic.\\nThe\\nContext\\nclass contains the extrinsic state, unique across all original objects. When a context is paired with one of the flyweight objects, it represents the full state of the original object.\\nUsually, the behavior of the original object remains in the flyweight class. In this case, whoever calls a flyweight’s method must also pass appropriate bits of the extrinsic state into the method’s parameters. On the other hand, the behavior can be moved to the context class, which would use the linked flyweight merely as a data object.\\nThe\\nClient\\ncalculates or stores the extrinsic state of flyweights. From the client’s perspective, a flyweight is a template object which can be configured at runtime by passing some contextual data into parameters of its methods.\\nThe\\nFlyweight Factory\\nmanages a pool of existing flyweights. With the factory, clients don’t create flyweights directly. Instead, they call the factory, passing it bits of the intrinsic state of the desired flyweight. The factory looks over previously created flyweights and either returns an existing one that matches search criteria or creates a new one if nothing is found.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nFlyweight\\npattern helps to reduce memory usage when rendering millions of tree objects on a canvas.\\nThe pattern extracts the repeating intrinsic state from a main\\nTree\\nclass and moves it into the flyweight class\\nTreeType\\n.\\nNow instead of storing the same data in multiple objects, it’s kept in just a few flyweight objects and linked to appropriate\\nTree\\nobjects which act as contexts. The client code creates new tree objects using the flyweight factory, which encapsulates the complexity of searching for the right object and reusing it if needed.\\n// The flyweight class contains a portion of the state of a\\n// tree. These fields store values that are unique for each\\n// particular tree. For instance, you won\\'t find here the tree\\n// coordinates. But the texture and colors shared between many\\n// trees are here. Since this data is usually BIG, you\\'d waste a\\n// lot of memory by keeping it in each tree object. Instead, we\\n// can extract texture, color and other repeating data into a\\n// separate object which lots of individual tree objects can\\n// reference.\\nclass TreeType is\\n    field name\\n    field color\\n    field texture\\n    constructor TreeType(name, color, texture) { ... }\\n    method draw(canvas, x, y) is\\n        // 1. Create a bitmap of a given type, color & texture.\\n        // 2. Draw the bitmap on the canvas at X and Y coords.\\n\\n// Flyweight factory decides whether to re-use existing\\n// flyweight or to create a new object.\\nclass TreeFactory is\\n    static field treeTypes: collection of tree types\\n    static method getTreeType(name, color, texture) is\\n        type = treeTypes.find(name, color, texture)\\n        if (type == null)\\n            type = new TreeType(name, color, texture)\\n            treeTypes.add(type)\\n        return type\\n\\n// The contextual object contains the extrinsic part of the tree\\n// state. An application can create billions of these since they\\n// are pretty small: just two integer coordinates and one\\n// reference field.\\nclass Tree is\\n    field x,y\\n    field type: TreeType\\n    constructor Tree(x, y, type) { ... }\\n    method draw(canvas) is\\n        type.draw(canvas, this.x, this.y)\\n\\n// The Tree and the Forest classes are the flyweight\\'s clients.\\n// You can merge them if you don\\'t plan to develop the Tree\\n// class any further.\\nclass Forest is\\n    field trees: collection of Trees\\n\\n    method plantTree(x, y, name, color, texture) is\\n        type = TreeFactory.getTreeType(name, color, texture)\\n        tree = new Tree(x, y, type)\\n        trees.add(tree)\\n\\n    method draw(canvas) is\\n        foreach (tree in trees) do\\n            tree.draw(canvas)\\nApplicability\\nUse the Flyweight pattern only when your program must support a huge number of objects which barely fit into available RAM.\\nThe benefit of applying the pattern depends heavily on how and where it’s used. It’s most useful when:\\nan application needs to spawn a huge number of similar objects\\nthis drains all available RAM on a target device\\nthe objects contain duplicate states which can be extracted and shared between multiple objects\\nHow to Implement\\nDivide fields of a class that will become a flyweight into two parts:\\nthe intrinsic state: the fields that contain unchanging data duplicated across many objects\\nthe extrinsic state: the fields that contain contextual data unique to each object\\nLeave the fields that represent the intrinsic state in the class, but make sure they’re immutable. They should take their initial values only inside the constructor.\\nGo over methods that use fields of the extrinsic state. For each field used in the method, introduce a new parameter and use it instead of the field.\\nOptionally, create a factory class to manage the pool of flyweights. It should check for an existing flyweight before creating a new one. Once the factory is in place, clients must only request flyweights through it. They should describe the desired flyweight by passing its intrinsic state to the factory.\\nThe client must store or calculate values of the extrinsic state (context) to be able to call methods of flyweight objects. For the sake of convenience, the extrinsic state along with the flyweight-referencing field may be moved to a separate context class.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can save lots of RAM, assuming your program has tons of similar objects.\\nYou might be trading RAM over CPU cycles when some of the context data needs to be recalculated each time somebody calls a flyweight method.\\nThe code becomes much more complicated. New team members will always be wondering why the state of an entity was separated in such a way.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nYou can implement shared leaf nodes of the\\nComposite\\ntree as\\nFlyweights\\nto save some RAM.\\nFlyweight\\nshows how to make lots of little objects, whereas\\nFacade\\nshows how to make a single object that represents an entire subsystem.\\nFlyweight\\nwould resemble\\nSingleton\\nif you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object. But there are two fundamental differences between these patterns:\\nThere should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a\\nFlyweight\\nclass can have multiple instances with different intrinsic states.\\nThe\\nSingleton\\nobject can be mutable.

A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original\\xa0object.\\nProblem\\nWhy would you want to control access to an object? Here is an example: you have a massive object that consumes a vast amount of system resources. You need it from time to time, but not always.\\nYou could implement lazy initialization: create this object only when it’s actually needed. All of the object’s clients would need to execute some deferred initialization code. Unfortunately, this would probably cause a lot of code duplication.\\nIn an ideal world, we’d want to put this code directly into our object’s class, but that isn’t always possible. For instance, the class may be part of a closed 3rd-party library.\\nSolution\\nThe Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original object’s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.\\nThe proxy disguises itself as a database object. It can handle lazy initialization and result caching without the client or the real database object even\\xa0knowing.\\nBut what’s the benefit? If you need to execute something either before or after the primary logic of the class, the proxy lets you do this without changing that class. Since the proxy implements the same interface as the original class, it can be passed to any client that expects a real service object.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nCredit cards can be used for payments just the same as\\xa0cash.\\nA credit card is a proxy for a bank account, which is a proxy for a bundle of cash. Both implement the same interface: they can be used for making a payment. A consumer feels great because there’s no need to carry loads of cash around. A shop owner is also happy since the income from a transaction gets added electronically to the shop’s bank account without the risk of losing the deposit or getting robbed on the way to the bank.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nService Interface\\ndeclares the interface of the Service. The proxy must follow this interface to be able to disguise itself as a service object.\\nThe\\nService\\nis a class that provides some useful business logic.\\nThe\\nProxy\\nclass has a reference field that points to a service object. After the proxy finishes its processing (e.g., lazy initialization, logging, access control, caching,\\xa0etc.), it passes the request to the service object.\\nUsually, proxies manage the full lifecycle of their service objects.\\nThe\\nClient\\nshould work with both services and proxies via the same interface. This way you can pass a proxy into any code that expects a service object.\\nPseudocode\\nThis example illustrates how the\\nProxy\\npattern can help to introduce lazy initialization and caching to a 3rd-party YouTube integration library.\\nCaching results of a service with a\\xa0proxy.\\nThe library provides us with the video downloading class. However, it’s very inefficient. If the client application requests the same video multiple times, the library just downloads it over and over, instead of caching and reusing the first downloaded file.\\nThe proxy class implements the same interface as the original downloader and delegates it all the work. However, it keeps track of the downloaded files and returns the cached result when the app requests the same video multiple times.\\n// The interface of a remote service.\\ninterface ThirdPartyYouTubeLib is\\n    method listVideos()\\n    method getVideoInfo(id)\\n    method downloadVideo(id)\\n\\n// The concrete implementation of a service connector. Methods\\n// of this class can request information from YouTube. The speed\\n// of the request depends on a user\\'s internet connection as\\n// well as YouTube\\'s. The application will slow down if a lot of\\n// requests are fired at the same time, even if they all request\\n// the same information.\\nclass ThirdPartyYouTubeClass implements ThirdPartyYouTubeLib is\\n    method listVideos() is\\n        // Send an API request to YouTube.\\n\\n    method getVideoInfo(id) is\\n        // Get metadata about some video.\\n\\n    method downloadVideo(id) is\\n        // Download a video file from YouTube.\\n\\n// To save some bandwidth, we can cache request results and keep\\n// them for some time. But it may be impossible to put such code\\n// directly into the service class. For example, it could have\\n// been provided as part of a third party library and/or defined\\n// as `final`. That\\'s why we put the caching code into a new\\n// proxy class which implements the same interface as the\\n// service class. It delegates to the service object only when\\n// the real requests have to be sent.\\nclass CachedYouTubeClass implements ThirdPartyYouTubeLib is\\n    private field service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib\\n    private field listCache, videoCache\\n    field needReset\\n\\n    constructor CachedYouTubeClass(service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib) is\\n        this.service = service\\n\\n    method listVideos() is\\n        if (listCache == null || needReset)\\n            listCache = service.listVideos()\\n        return listCache\\n\\n    method getVideoInfo(id) is\\n        if (videoCache == null || needReset)\\n            videoCache = service.getVideoInfo(id)\\n        return videoCache\\n\\n    method downloadVideo(id) is\\n        if (!downloadExists(id) || needReset)\\n            service.downloadVideo(id)\\n\\n// The GUI class, which used to work directly with a service\\n// object, stays unchanged as long as it works with the service\\n// object through an interface. We can safely pass a proxy\\n// object instead of a real service object since they both\\n// implement the same interface.\\nclass YouTubeManager is\\n    protected field service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib\\n\\n    constructor YouTubeManager(service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib) is\\n        this.service = service\\n\\n    method renderVideoPage(id) is\\n        info = service.getVideoInfo(id)\\n        // Render the video page.\\n\\n    method renderListPanel() is\\n        list = service.listVideos()\\n        // Render the list of video thumbnails.\\n\\n    method reactOnUserInput() is\\n        renderVideoPage()\\n        renderListPanel()\\n\\n// The application can configure proxies on the fly.\\nclass Application is\\n    method init() is\\n        aYouTubeService = new ThirdPartyYouTubeClass()\\n        aYouTubeProxy = new CachedYouTubeClass(aYouTubeService)\\n        manager = new YouTubeManager(aYouTubeProxy)\\n        manager.reactOnUserInput()\\nApplicability\\nThere are dozens of ways to utilize the Proxy pattern. Let’s go over the most popular uses.\\nLazy initialization (virtual proxy). This is when you have a heavyweight service object that wastes system resources by being always up, even though you only need it from time to time.\\nInstead of creating the object when the app launches, you can delay the object’s initialization to a time when it’s really needed.\\nAccess control (protection proxy). This is when you want only specific clients to be able to use the service object; for instance, when your objects are crucial parts of an operating system and clients are various launched applications (including malicious ones).\\nThe proxy can pass the request to the service object only if the client’s credentials match some criteria.\\nLocal execution of a remote service (remote proxy). This is when the service object is located on a remote server.\\nIn this case, the proxy passes the client request over the network, handling all of the nasty details of working with the network.\\nLogging requests (logging proxy). This is when you want to keep a history of requests to the service object.\\nThe proxy can log each request before passing it to the service.\\nCaching request results (caching proxy). This is when you need to cache results of client requests and manage the life cycle of this cache, especially if results are quite large.\\nThe proxy can implement caching for recurring requests that always yield the same results. The proxy may use the parameters of requests as the cache keys.\\nSmart reference. This is when you need to be able to dismiss a heavyweight object once there are no clients that use it.\\nThe proxy can keep track of clients that obtained a reference to the service object or its results. From time to time, the proxy may go over the clients and check whether they are still active. If the client list gets empty, the proxy might dismiss the service object and free the underlying system resources.\\nThe proxy can also track whether the client had modified the service object. Then the unchanged objects may be reused by other clients.\\nHow to Implement\\nIf there’s no pre-existing service interface, create one to make proxy and service objects interchangeable. Extracting the interface from the service class isn’t always possible, because you’d need to change all of the service’s clients to use that interface. Plan B is to make the proxy a subclass of the service class, and this way it’ll inherit the interface of the service.\\nCreate the proxy class. It should have a field for storing a reference to the service. Usually, proxies create and manage the whole life cycle of their services. On rare occasions, a service is passed to the proxy via a constructor by the client.\\nImplement the proxy methods according to their purposes. In most cases, after doing some work, the proxy should delegate the work to the service object.\\nConsider introducing a creation method that decides whether the client gets a proxy or a real service. This can be a simple static method in the proxy class or a full-blown factory method.\\nConsider implementing lazy initialization for the service object.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can control the service object without clients knowing about it.\\nYou can manage the lifecycle of the service object when clients don’t care about it.\\nThe proxy works even if the service object isn’t ready or is not available.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new proxies without changing the service or clients.\\nThe code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new classes.\\nThe response from the service might get delayed.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nWith\\nAdapter\\nyou access an existing object via different interface. With\\nProxy\\n, the interface stays the same. With\\nDecorator\\nyou access the object via an enhanced interface.\\nFacade\\nis similar to\\nProxy\\nin that both buffer a complex entity and initialize it on its own. Unlike\\nFacade\\n,\\nProxy\\nhas the same interface as its service object, which makes them interchangeable.\\nDecorator\\nand\\nProxy\\nhave similar structures, but very different intents. Both patterns are built on the composition principle, where one object is supposed to delegate some of the work to another. The difference is that a\\nProxy\\nusually manages the life cycle of its service object on its own, whereas the composition of\\nDecorators\\nis always controlled by the client.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained in depth.\\n409 well-structured, easy to read, jargon-free pages.\\n225 clear and helpful illustrations and diagrams.\\nAn archive with code examples in 11 languages.\\nAll devices supported: PDF/EPUB/MOBI/KFX formats.\\nLearn more…\\nRead next\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nReturn\\nFlyweight\\nThis article is a part of our eBook\\nDive Into Design Patterns\\n.\\nLearn more…\\nPremium Content\\nDesign Patterns eBook\\nRefactoring Course\\nRefactoring\\nWhat is Refactoring\\nClean code\\nTechnical debt\\nWhen to refactor\\nHow to refactor\\nCatalog\\nCode Smells\\nBloaters\\nLong Method\\nLarge Class\\nPrimitive Obsession\\nLong Parameter List\\nData Clumps\\nObject-Orientation Abusers\\nSwitch Statements\\nTemporary Field\\nRefused Bequest\\nAlternative Classes with Different Interfaces\\nChange Preventers\\nDivergent Change\\nShotgun Surgery\\nParallel Inheritance Hierarchies\\nDispensables\\nComments\\nDuplicate Code\\nLazy Class\\nData Class\\nDead Code\\nSpeculative Generality\\nCouplers\\nFeature Envy\\nInappropriate Intimacy\\nMessage Chains\\nMiddle Man\\nOther Smells\\nIncomplete Library Class\\nRefactorings\\nComposing Methods\\nExtract Method\\nInline Method\\nExtract Variable\\nInline Temp\\nReplace Temp with Query\\nSplit Temporary Variable\\nRemove Assignments to Parameters\\nReplace Method with Method Object\\nSubstitute Algorithm\\nMoving Features between Objects\\nMove Method\\nMove Field\\nExtract Class\\nInline Class\\nHide Delegate\\nRemove Middle Man\\nIntroduce Foreign Method\\nIntroduce Local Extension\\nOrganizing Data\\nSelf Encapsulate Field\\nReplace Data Value with Object\\nChange Value to Reference\\nChange Reference to Value\\nReplace Array with Object\\nDuplicate Observed Data\\nChange Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional\\nChange Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional\\nReplace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant\\nEncapsulate Field\\nEncapsulate Collection\\nReplace Type Code with Class\\nReplace Type Code with Subclasses\\nReplace Type Code with State/Strategy\\nReplace Subclass with Fields\\nSimplifying Conditional Expressions\\nDecompose Conditional\\nConsolidate Conditional Expression\\nConsolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments\\nRemove Control Flag\\nReplace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses\\nReplace Conditional with Polymorphism\\nIntroduce Null Object\\nIntroduce Assertion\\nSimplifying Method Calls\\nRename Method\\nAdd Parameter\\nRemove Parameter\\nSeparate Query from Modifier\\nParameterize Method\\nReplace Parameter with Explicit Methods\\nPreserve Whole Object\\nReplace Parameter with Method Call\\nIntroduce Parameter Object\\nRemove Setting Method\\nHide Method\\nReplace Constructor with Factory Method\\nReplace Error Code with Exception\\nReplace Exception with Test\\nDealing with Generalization\\nPull Up Field\\nPull Up Method\\nPull Up Constructor Body\\nPush Down Method\\nPush Down Field\\nExtract Subclass\\nExtract Superclass\\nExtract Interface\\nCollapse Hierarchy\\nForm Template Method\\nReplace Inheritance with Delegation\\nReplace Delegation with Inheritance\\nDesign Patterns\\nWhat is a Pattern\\nWhat\\'s a design pattern?\\nHistory of patterns\\nWhy should I learn patterns?\\nCriticism of patterns\\nClassification of patterns\\nCatalog\\nCreational Patterns\\nFactory Method\\nAbstract Factory\\nBuilder\\nPrototype\\nSingleton\\nStructural Patterns\\nAdapter\\nBridge\\nComposite\\nDecorator\\nFacade\\nFlyweight\\nProxy\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\nCommand\\nIterator\\nMediator\\nMemento\\nObserver\\nState\\nStrategy\\nTemplate Method\\nVisitor\\nCode Examples\\nC#\\nC++\\nGo\\nJava\\nPHP\\nPython\\nRuby\\nRust\\nSwift\\nTypeScript\\nSign in\\nContact us\\nShop Now!\\nEnglish\\nEnglish\\nEspañol\\nFrançais\\n日本語\\n한국어\\nPolski\\nPortuguês Brasileiro\\nРусский\\nУкраїнська\\n中文\\nContact us\\nSign in\\nHome\\nRefactoring\\nDesign Patterns\\nPremium Content\\nForum\\nContact us\\n2014-2025\\nRefactoring.Guru\\n.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nIllustrations by\\nDmitry Zhart\\nTerms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nContent Usage Policy\\nAbout us\\nUkrainian office:\\nFOP Olga Skobeleva\\nAbolmasova 7\\nKyiv, Ukraine, 02002\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\nSpanish office:\\nOleksandr Shvets\\nAvda Pamplona 64\\nPamplona, Spain, 31009\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\n\\nChain of Responsibility\\n\\nWebpage title:\\nChain of Responsibility\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\nAlso known as:\\nCoR,\\nChain of Command\\nIntent\\nChain of Responsibility\\nis a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the\\xa0chain.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you’re working on an online ordering system. You want to restrict access to the system so only authenticated users can create orders. Also, users who have administrative permissions must have full access to all orders.\\nAfter a bit of planning, you realized that these checks must be performed sequentially. The application can attempt to authenticate a user to the system whenever it receives a request that contains the user’s credentials. However, if those credentials aren’t correct and authentication fails, there’s no reason to proceed with any other checks.\\nDuring the next few months, you implemented several more of those sequential checks.\\nOne of your colleagues suggested that it’s unsafe to pass raw data straight to the ordering system. So you added an extra validation step to sanitize the data in a request.\\nLater, somebody noticed that the system is vulnerable to brute force password cracking. To negate this, you promptly added a check that filters repeated failed requests coming from the same IP address.\\nSomeone else suggested that you could speed up the system by returning cached results on repeated requests containing the same data. Hence, you added another check which lets the request pass through to the system only if there’s no suitable cached response.\\nThe bigger the code grew, the messier it\\xa0became.\\nThe code of the checks, which had already looked like a mess, became more and more bloated as you added each new feature. Changing one check sometimes affected the others. Worst of all, when you tried to reuse the checks to protect other components of the system, you had to duplicate some of the code since those components required some of the checks, but not all of them.\\nThe system became very hard to comprehend and expensive to maintain. You struggled with the code for a while, until one day you decided to refactor the whole thing.\\nSolution\\nLike many other behavioral design patterns, the\\nChain of Responsibility\\nrelies on transforming particular behaviors into stand-alone objects called\\nhandlers\\n. In our case, each check should be extracted to its own class with a single method that performs the check. The request, along with its data, is passed to this method as an argument.\\nThe pattern suggests that you link these handlers into a chain. Each linked handler has a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. In addition to processing a request, handlers pass the request further along the chain. The request travels along the chain until all handlers have had a chance to process it.\\nHere’s the best part: a handler can decide not to pass the request further down the chain and effectively stop any further processing.\\nIn our example with ordering systems, a handler performs the processing and then decides whether to pass the request further down the chain. Assuming the request contains the right data, all the handlers can execute their primary behavior, whether it’s authentication checks or caching.\\nHandlers are lined up one by one, forming a\\xa0chain.\\nHowever, there’s a slightly different approach (and it’s a bit more canonical) in which, upon receiving a request, a handler decides whether it can process it. If it can, it doesn’t pass the request any further. So it’s either only one handler that processes the request or none at all. This approach is very common when dealing with events in stacks of elements within a graphical user interface.\\nFor instance, when a user clicks a button, the event propagates through the chain of GUI elements that starts with the button, goes along its containers (like forms or panels), and ends up with the main application window. The event is processed by the first element in the chain that’s capable of handling it. This example is also noteworthy because it shows that a chain can always be extracted from an object tree.\\nA chain can be formed from a branch of an object\\xa0tree.\\nIt’s crucial that all handler classes implement the same interface. Each concrete handler should only care about the following one having the\\nexecute\\nmethod. This way you can compose chains at runtime, using various handlers without coupling your code to their concrete classes.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nA call to tech support can go through multiple\\xa0operators.\\nYou’ve just bought and installed a new piece of hardware on your computer. Since you’re a geek, the computer has several operating systems installed. You try to boot all of them to see whether the hardware is supported. Windows detects and enables the hardware automatically. However, your beloved Linux refuses to work with the new hardware. With a small flicker of hope, you decide to call the tech-support phone number written on the box.\\nThe first thing you hear is the robotic voice of the autoresponder. It suggests nine popular solutions to various problems, none of which are relevant to your case. After a while, the robot connects you to a live operator.\\nAlas, the operator isn’t able to suggest anything specific either. He keeps quoting lengthy excerpts from the manual, refusing to listen to your comments. After hearing the phrase “have you tried turning the computer off and on again?” for the 10th time, you demand to be connected to a proper engineer.\\nEventually, the operator passes your call to one of the engineers, who had probably longed for a live human chat for hours as he sat in his lonely server room in the dark basement of some office building. The engineer tells you where to download proper drivers for your new hardware and how to install them on Linux. Finally, the solution! You end the call, bursting with joy.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nHandler\\ndeclares the interface, common for all concrete handlers. It usually  contains just a single method for handling requests, but sometimes it may also have another method for setting the next handler on the chain.\\nThe\\nBase Handler\\nis an optional class where you can put the boilerplate code that’s common to all handler classes.\\nUsually, this class defines a field for storing a reference to the next handler. The clients can build a chain by passing a handler to the constructor or setter of the previous handler. The class may also implement the default handling behavior: it can pass execution to the next handler after checking for its existence.\\nConcrete Handlers\\ncontain the actual code for processing requests. Upon receiving a request, each handler must decide whether to process it and, additionally, whether to pass it along the chain.\\nHandlers are usually self-contained and immutable, accepting all necessary data just once via the constructor.\\nThe\\nClient\\nmay compose chains just once or compose them dynamically, depending on the application’s logic. Note that a request can be sent to any handler in the chain—it doesn’t have to be the first one.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nChain of Responsibility\\npattern is responsible for displaying contextual help information for active GUI elements.\\nThe GUI classes are built with the Composite pattern. Each element is linked to its container element. At any point, you can build a chain of elements that starts with the element itself and goes through all of its container\\xa0elements.\\nThe application’s GUI is usually structured as an object tree. For example, the\\nDialog\\nclass, which renders the main window of the app, would be the root of the object tree. The dialog contains\\nPanels\\n, which might contain other panels or simple low-level elements like\\nButtons\\nand\\nTextFields\\n.\\nA simple component can show brief contextual tooltips, as long as the component has some help text assigned. But more complex components define their own way of showing contextual help, such as showing an excerpt from the manual or opening a page in a browser.\\nThat’s how a help request traverses GUI\\xa0objects.\\nWhen a user points the mouse cursor at an element and presses the\\nF1\\nkey, the application detects the component under the pointer and sends it a help request. The request bubbles up through all the element’s containers until it reaches the element that’s capable of displaying the help information.\\n// The handler interface declares a method for executing a\\n// request.\\ninterface ComponentWithContextualHelp is\\n    method showHelp()\\n\\n\\n// The base class for simple components.\\nabstract class Component implements ComponentWithContextualHelp is\\n    field tooltipText: string\\n\\n    // The component\\'s container acts as the next link in the\\n    // chain of handlers.\\n    protected field container: Container\\n\\n    // The component shows a tooltip if there\\'s help text\\n    // assigned to it.

This way all handlers get a chance to process the request.\\nUse the pattern when it’s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.\\nSince you can link the handlers in the chain in any order, all requests will get through the chain exactly as you planned.\\nUse the CoR pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime.\\nIf you provide setters for a reference field inside the handler classes, you’ll be able to insert, remove or reorder handlers dynamically.\\nHow to Implement\\nDeclare the handler interface and describe the signature of a method for handling requests.\\nDecide how the client will pass the request data into the method. The most flexible way is to convert the request into an object and pass it to the handling method as an argument.\\nTo eliminate duplicate boilerplate code in concrete handlers, it might be worth creating an abstract base handler class, derived from the handler interface.\\nThis class should have a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. Consider making the class immutable. However, if you plan to modify chains at runtime, you need to define a setter for altering the value of the reference field.\\nYou can also implement the convenient default behavior for the handling method, which is to forward the request to the next object unless there’s none left. Concrete handlers will be able to use this behavior by calling the parent method.\\nOne by one create concrete handler subclasses and implement their handling methods. Each handler should make two decisions when receiving a request:\\nWhether it’ll process the request.\\nWhether it’ll pass the request along the chain.\\nThe client may either assemble chains on its own or receive pre-built chains from other objects. In the latter case, you must implement some factory classes to build chains according to the configuration or environment settings.\\nThe client may trigger any handler in the chain, not just the first one. The request will be passed along the chain until some handler refuses to pass it further or until it reaches the end of the chain.\\nDue to the dynamic nature of the chain, the client should be ready to handle the following scenarios:\\nThe chain may consist of a single link.\\nSome requests may not reach the end of the chain.\\nOthers may reach the end of the chain unhandled.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can control the order of request handling.\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform operations.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new handlers into the app without breaking the existing client code.\\nSome requests may end up unhandled.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\n,\\nCommand\\n,\\nMediator\\nand\\nObserver\\naddress various ways of connecting senders and receivers of requests:\\nChain of Responsibility\\npasses a request sequentially along a dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles it.\\nCommand\\nestablishes unidirectional connections between senders and receivers.\\nMediator\\neliminates direct connections between senders and receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator object.\\nObserver\\nlets receivers dynamically subscribe to and unsubscribe from receiving requests.\\nChain of Responsibility\\nis often used in conjunction with\\nComposite\\n. In this case, when a leaf component gets a request, it may pass it through the chain of all of the parent components down to the root of the object tree.\\nHandlers in\\nChain of Responsibility\\ncan be implemented as\\nCommands\\n. In this case, you can execute a lot of different operations over the same context object, represented by a request.\\nHowever, there’s another approach, where the request itself is a\\nCommand\\nobject. In this case, you can execute the same operation in a series of different contexts linked into a chain.\\nChain of Responsibility\\nand\\nDecorator\\nhave very similar class structures. Both patterns rely on recursive composition to pass the execution through a series of objects. However, there are several crucial differences.\\nThe\\nCoR\\nhandlers can execute arbitrary operations independently of each other. They can also stop passing the request further at any point. On the other hand, various\\nDecorators\\ncan extend the object’s behavior while keeping it consistent with the base interface. In addition, decorators aren’t allowed to break the flow of the request.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained in depth.\\n409 well-structured, easy to read, jargon-free pages.\\n225 clear and helpful illustrations and diagrams.\\nAn archive with code examples in 11 languages.\\nAll devices supported: PDF/EPUB/MOBI/KFX formats.\\nLearn more…\\nRead next\\nCommand\\nReturn\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nThis article is a part of our eBook\\nDive Into Design Patterns\\n.\\nLearn more…\\nPremium Content\\nDesign Patterns eBook\\nRefactoring Course\\nRefactoring\\nWhat is Refactoring\\nClean code\\nTechnical debt\\nWhen to refactor\\nHow to refactor\\nCatalog\\nCode Smells\\nBloaters\\nLong Method\\nLarge Class\\nPrimitive Obsession\\nLong Parameter List\\nData Clumps\\nObject-Orientation Abusers\\nSwitch Statements\\nTemporary Field\\nRefused Bequest\\nAlternative Classes with Different Interfaces\\nChange Preventers\\nDivergent Change\\nShotgun Surgery\\nParallel Inheritance Hierarchies\\nDispensables\\nComments\\nDuplicate Code\\nLazy Class\\nData Class\\nDead Code\\nSpeculative Generality\\nCouplers\\nFeature Envy\\nInappropriate Intimacy\\nMessage Chains\\nMiddle Man\\nOther Smells\\nIncomplete Library Class\\nRefactorings\\nComposing Methods\\nExtract Method\\nInline Method\\nExtract Variable\\nInline Temp\\nReplace Temp with Query\\nSplit Temporary Variable\\nRemove Assignments to Parameters\\nReplace Method with Method Object\\nSubstitute Algorithm\\nMoving Features between Objects\\nMove Method\\nMove Field\\nExtract Class\\nInline Class\\nHide Delegate\\nRemove Middle Man\\nIntroduce Foreign Method\\nIntroduce Local Extension\\nOrganizing Data\\nSelf Encapsulate Field\\nReplace Data Value with Object\\nChange Value to Reference\\nChange Reference to Value\\nReplace Array with Object\\nDuplicate Observed Data\\nChange Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional\\nChange Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional\\nReplace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant\\nEncapsulate Field\\nEncapsulate Collection\\nReplace Type Code with Class\\nReplace Type Code with Subclasses\\nReplace Type Code with State/Strategy\\nReplace Subclass with Fields\\nSimplifying Conditional Expressions\\nDecompose Conditional\\nConsolidate Conditional Expression\\nConsolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments\\nRemove Control Flag\\nReplace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses\\nReplace Conditional with Polymorphism\\nIntroduce Null Object\\nIntroduce Assertion\\nSimplifying Method Calls\\nRename Method\\nAdd Parameter\\nRemove Parameter\\nSeparate Query from Modifier\\nParameterize Method\\nReplace Parameter with Explicit Methods\\nPreserve Whole Object\\nReplace Parameter with Method Call\\nIntroduce Parameter Object\\nRemove Setting Method\\nHide Method\\nReplace Constructor with Factory Method\\nReplace Error Code with Exception\\nReplace Exception with Test\\nDealing with Generalization\\nPull Up Field\\nPull Up Method\\nPull Up Constructor Body\\nPush Down Method\\nPush Down Field\\nExtract Subclass\\nExtract Superclass\\nExtract Interface\\nCollapse Hierarchy\\nForm Template Method\\nReplace Inheritance with Delegation\\nReplace Delegation with Inheritance\\nDesign Patterns\\nWhat is a Pattern\\nWhat\\'s a design pattern?\\nHistory of patterns\\nWhy should I learn patterns?\\nCriticism of patterns\\nClassification of patterns\\nCatalog\\nCreational Patterns\\nFactory Method\\nAbstract Factory\\nBuilder\\nPrototype\\nSingleton\\nStructural Patterns\\nAdapter\\nBridge\\nComposite\\nDecorator\\nFacade\\nFlyweight\\nProxy\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\nCommand\\nIterator\\nMediator\\nMemento\\nObserver\\nState\\nStrategy\\nTemplate Method\\nVisitor\\nCode Examples\\nC#\\nC++\\nGo\\nJava\\nPHP\\nPython\\nRuby\\nRust\\nSwift\\nTypeScript\\nSign in\\nContact us\\nShop Now!\\nEnglish\\nEnglish\\nEspañol\\nFrançais\\n日本語\\n한국어\\nPolski\\nPortuguês Brasileiro\\nРусский\\nУкраїнська\\n中文\\nContact us\\nSign in\\nHome\\nRefactoring\\nDesign Patterns\\nPremium Content\\nForum\\nContact us\\n2014-2025\\nRefactoring.Guru\\n.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nIllustrations by\\nDmitry Zhart\\nTerms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nContent Usage Policy\\nAbout us\\nUkrainian office:\\nFOP Olga Skobeleva\\nAbolmasova 7\\nKyiv, Ukraine, 02002\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\nSpanish office:\\nOleksandr Shvets\\nAvda Pamplona 64\\nPamplona, Spain, 31009\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\n\\nCommand\\n\\nWebpage title:\\nCommand\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nCommand\\nAlso known as:\\nAction,\\nTransaction\\nIntent\\nCommand\\nis a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable\\xa0operations.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you’re working on a new text-editor app. Your current task is to create a toolbar with a bunch of buttons for various operations of the editor. You created a very neat\\nButton\\nclass that can be used for buttons on the toolbar, as well as for generic buttons in various dialogs.\\nWhile all of these buttons look similar, they’re all supposed to do different things. Where would you put the code for the various click handlers of these buttons? The simplest solution is to create tons of subclasses for each place where the button is used. These subclasses would contain the code that would have to be executed on a button click.\\nLots of button subclasses. What can go\\xa0wrong?\\nBefore long, you realize that this approach is deeply flawed. First, you have an enormous number of subclasses, and that would be okay if you weren’t risking breaking the code in these subclasses each time you modify the base\\nButton\\nclass. Put simply, your GUI code has become awkwardly dependent on the volatile code of the business logic.\\nSeveral classes implement the same\\xa0functionality.\\nAnd here’s the ugliest part. Some operations, such as copying/pasting text, would need to be invoked from multiple places. For example, a user could click a small “Copy” button on the toolbar, or copy something via the context menu, or just hit\\nCtrl+C\\non the keyboard.\\nInitially, when our app only had the toolbar, it was okay to place the implementation of various operations into the button subclasses. In other words, having the code for copying text inside the\\nCopyButton\\nsubclass was fine. But then, when you implement context menus, shortcuts, and other stuff, you have to either duplicate the operation’s code in many classes or make menus dependent on buttons, which is an even worse option.\\nSolution\\nGood software design is often based on the\\nprinciple of separation of concerns\\n, which usually results in breaking an app into layers. The most common example: a layer for the graphical user interface and another layer for the business logic. The GUI layer is responsible for rendering a beautiful picture on the screen, capturing any input and showing results of what the user and the app are doing. However, when it comes to doing something important, like calculating the trajectory of the moon or composing an annual report, the GUI layer delegates the work to the underlying layer of business logic.\\nIn the code it might look like this: a GUI object calls a method of a business logic object, passing it some arguments. This process is usually described as one object sending another a\\nrequest\\n.\\nThe GUI objects may access the business logic objects\\xa0directly.\\nThe Command pattern suggests that GUI objects shouldn’t send these requests directly. Instead, you should extract all of the request details, such as the object being called, the name of the method and the list of arguments into a separate\\ncommand\\nclass with a single method that triggers this request.\\nCommand objects serve as links between various GUI and business logic objects. From now on, the GUI object doesn’t need to know what business logic object will receive the request and how it’ll be processed. The GUI object just triggers the command, which handles all the details.\\nAccessing the business logic layer via a\\xa0command.\\nThe next step is to make your commands implement the same interface. Usually it has just a single execution method that takes no parameters. This interface lets you use various commands with the same request sender, without coupling it to concrete classes of commands. As a bonus, now you can switch command objects linked to the sender, effectively changing the sender’s behavior at runtime.\\nYou might have noticed one missing piece of the puzzle, which is the request parameters. A GUI object might have supplied the business-layer object with some parameters. Since the command execution method doesn’t have any parameters, how would we pass the request details to the receiver? It turns out the command should be either pre-configured with this data, or capable of getting it on its own.\\nThe GUI objects delegate the work to\\xa0commands.\\nLet’s get back to our text editor. After we apply the Command pattern, we no longer need all those button subclasses to implement various click behaviors. It’s enough to put a single field into the base\\nButton\\nclass that stores a reference to a command object and make the button execute that command on a click.\\nYou’ll implement a bunch of command classes for every possible operation and link them with particular buttons, depending on the buttons’ intended behavior.\\nOther GUI elements, such as menus, shortcuts or entire dialogs, can be implemented in the same way. They’ll be linked to a command which gets executed when a user interacts with the GUI element. As you’ve probably guessed by now, the elements related to the same operations will be linked to the same commands, preventing any code duplication.\\nAs a result, commands become a convenient middle layer that reduces coupling between the GUI and business logic layers. And that’s only a fraction of the benefits that the Command pattern can offer!\\nReal-World Analogy\\nMaking an order in a\\xa0restaurant.\\nAfter a long walk through the city, you get to a nice restaurant and sit at the table by the window. A friendly waiter approaches you and quickly takes your order, writing it down on a piece of paper. The waiter goes to the kitchen and sticks the order on the wall. After a while, the order gets to the chef, who reads it and cooks the meal accordingly. The cook places the meal on a tray along with the order. The waiter discovers the tray, checks the order to make sure everything is as you wanted it, and brings everything to your table.\\nThe paper order serves as a command. It remains in a queue until the chef is ready to serve it. The order contains all the relevant information required to cook the meal. It allows the chef to start cooking right away instead of running around clarifying the order details from you directly.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nSender\\nclass (aka\\ninvoker\\n) is responsible for initiating requests. This class must have a field for storing a reference to a command object. The sender triggers that command instead of sending the request directly to the receiver. Note that the sender isn’t responsible for creating the command object. Usually, it gets a pre-created command from the client via the constructor.\\nThe\\nCommand\\ninterface usually declares just a single method for executing the command.\\nConcrete Commands\\nimplement various kinds of requests. A concrete command isn’t supposed to perform the work on its own, but rather to pass the call to one of the business logic objects. However, for the sake of simplifying the code, these classes can be merged.\\nParameters required to execute a method on a receiving object can be declared as fields in the concrete command. You can make command objects immutable by only allowing the initialization of these fields via the constructor.\\nThe\\nReceiver\\nclass contains some business logic. Almost any object may act as a receiver. Most commands only handle the details of how a request is passed to the receiver, while the receiver itself does the actual work.\\nThe\\nClient\\ncreates and configures concrete command objects. The client must pass all of the request parameters, including a receiver instance, into the command’s constructor. After that, the resulting command may be associated with one or multiple senders.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nCommand\\npattern helps to track the history of executed operations and makes it possible to revert an operation if needed.\\nUndoable operations in a text\\xa0editor.\\nCommands which result in changing the state of the editor (e.g., cutting and pasting) make a backup copy of the editor’s state before executing an operation associated with the command. After a command is executed, it’s placed into the command history (a stack of command objects) along with the backup copy of the editor’s state at that point. Later, if the user needs to revert an operation, the app can take the most recent command from the history, read the associated backup of the editor’s state, and restore it.\\nThe client code (GUI elements, command history,\\xa0etc.) isn’t coupled to concrete command classes because it works with commands via the command interface. This approach lets you introduce new commands into the app without breaking any existing code.\\n// The base command class defines the common interface for all\\n// concrete commands.\\nabstract class Command is\\n    protected field app: Application\\n    protected field editor: Editor\\n    protected field backup: text\\n\\n    constructor Command(app: Application, editor: Editor) is\\n        this.app = app\\n        this.editor = editor\\n\\n    // Make a backup of the editor\\'s state.\\n    method saveBackup() is\\n        backup = editor.text\\n\\n    // Restore the editor\\'s state.\\n    method undo() is\\n        editor.text = backup\\n\\n    // The execution method is declared abstract to force all\\n    // concrete commands to provide their own implementations.\\n    // The method must return true or false depending on whether\\n    // the command changes the editor\\'s state.\\n    abstract method execute()\\n\\n\\n// The concrete commands go here.\\nclass CopyCommand extends Command is\\n    // The copy command isn\\'t saved to the history since it\\n    // doesn\\'t change the editor\\'s state.\\n    method execute() is\\n        app.clipboard = editor.getSelection()\\n        return false\\n\\nclass CutCommand extends Command is\\n    // The cut command does change the editor\\'s state, therefore\\n    // it must be saved to the history.

This change opens up a lot of interesting uses: you can pass commands as method arguments, store them inside other objects, switch linked commands at runtime,\\xa0etc.\\nHere’s an example: you’re developing a GUI component such as a context menu, and you want your users to be able to configure menu items that trigger operations when an end user clicks an item.\\nUse the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.\\nAs with any other object, a command can be serialized, which means converting it to a string that can be easily written to a file or a database. Later, the string can be restored as the initial command object. Thus, you can delay and schedule command execution. But there’s even more! In the same way, you can queue, log or send commands over the network.\\nUse the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations.\\nAlthough there are many ways to implement undo/redo, the Command pattern is perhaps the most popular of all.\\nTo be able to revert operations, you need to implement the history of performed operations. The command history is a stack that contains all executed command objects along with related backups of the application’s state.\\nThis method has two drawbacks. First, it isn’t that easy to save an application’s state because some of it can be private. This problem can be mitigated with the\\nMemento\\npattern.\\nSecond, the state backups may consume quite a lot of RAM. Therefore, sometimes you can resort to an alternative implementation: instead of restoring the past state, the command performs the inverse operation. The reverse operation also has a price: it may turn out to be hard or even impossible to implement.\\nHow to Implement\\nDeclare the command interface with a single execution method.\\nStart extracting requests into concrete command classes that implement the command interface. Each class must have a set of fields for storing the request arguments along with a reference to the actual receiver object. All these values must be initialized via the command’s constructor.\\nIdentify classes that will act as\\nsenders\\n. Add the fields for storing commands into these classes.

Nonetheless, a collection is just a container for a group of objects.\\nMost collections store their elements in simple lists. However, some of them are based on stacks, trees, graphs and other complex data structures.\\nBut no matter how a collection is structured, it must provide some way of accessing its elements so that other code can use these elements. There should be a way to go through each element of the collection without accessing the same elements over and over.\\nThis may sound like an easy job if you have a collection based on a list. You just loop over all of the elements. But how do you sequentially traverse elements of a complex data structure, such as a tree? For example, one day you might be just fine with depth-first traversal of a tree. Yet the next day you might require breadth-first traversal. And the next week, you might need something else, like random access to the tree elements.\\nThe same collection can be traversed in several different\\xa0ways.\\nAdding more and more traversal algorithms to the collection gradually blurs its primary responsibility, which is efficient data storage. Additionally, some algorithms might be tailored for a specific application, so including them into a generic collection class would be weird.\\nOn the other hand, the client code that’s supposed to work with various collections may not even care how they store their elements. However, since collections all provide different ways of accessing their elements, you have no option other than to couple your code to the specific collection classes.\\nSolution\\nThe main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an\\niterator\\n.\\nIterators implement various traversal algorithms. Several iterator objects can traverse the same collection at the same\\xa0time.\\nIn addition to implementing the algorithm itself, an iterator object encapsulates all of the traversal details, such as the current position and how many elements are left till the end. Because of this, several iterators can go through the same collection at the same time, independently of each other.\\nUsually, iterators provide one primary method for fetching elements of the collection. The client can keep running this method until it doesn’t return anything, which means that the iterator has traversed all of the elements.\\nAll iterators must implement the same interface. This makes the client code compatible with any collection type or any traversal algorithm as long as there’s a proper iterator. If you need a special way to traverse a collection, you just create a new iterator class, without having to change the collection or the client.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nVarious ways to walk around\\xa0Rome.\\nYou plan to visit Rome for a few days and visit all of its main sights and attractions. But once there, you could waste a lot of time walking in circles, unable to find even the Colosseum.\\nOn the other hand, you could buy a virtual guide app for your smartphone and use it for navigation. It’s smart and inexpensive, and you could be staying at some interesting places for as long as you want.\\nA third alternative is that you could spend some of the trip’s budget and hire a local guide who knows the city like the back of his hand. The guide would be able to tailor the tour to your likings, show you every attraction and tell a lot of exciting stories. That’ll be even more fun; but, alas, more expensive, too.\\nAll of these options—the random directions born in your head, the smartphone navigator or the human guide—act as iterators over the vast collection of sights and attractions located in Rome.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nIterator\\ninterface declares the operations required for traversing a collection: fetching the next element, retrieving the current position, restarting iteration,\\xa0etc.\\nConcrete Iterators\\nimplement specific algorithms for traversing a collection. The iterator object should track the traversal progress on its own. This allows several iterators to traverse the same collection independently of each other.\\nThe\\nCollection\\ninterface declares one or multiple methods for getting iterators compatible with the collection. Note that the return type of the methods must be declared as the iterator interface so that the concrete collections can return various kinds of iterators.\\nConcrete Collections\\nreturn new instances of a particular concrete iterator class each time the client requests one. You might be wondering, where’s the rest of the collection’s code? Don’t worry, it should be in the same class. It’s just that these details aren’t crucial to the actual pattern, so we’re omitting them.\\nThe\\nClient\\nworks with both collections and iterators via their interfaces. This way the client isn’t coupled to concrete classes, allowing you to use various collections and iterators with the same client code.\\nTypically, clients don’t create iterators on their own, but instead get them from collections. Yet, in certain cases, the client can create one directly; for example, when the client defines its own special iterator.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nIterator\\npattern is used to walk through a special kind of collection which encapsulates access to Facebook’s social graph. The collection provides several iterators that can traverse profiles in various ways.\\nExample of iterating over social\\xa0profiles.\\nThe ‘friends’ iterator can be used to go over the friends of a given profile. The ‘colleagues’ iterator does the same, except it omits friends who don’t work at the same company as a target person. Both iterators implement a common interface which allows clients to fetch profiles without diving into implementation details such as authentication and sending REST requests.\\nThe client code isn’t coupled to concrete classes because it works with collections and iterators only through interfaces. If you decide to connect your app to a new social network, you simply need to provide new collection and iterator classes without changing the existing code.\\n// The collection interface must declare a factory method for\\n// producing iterators. You can declare several methods if there\\n// are different kinds of iteration available in your program.\\ninterface SocialNetwork is\\n    method createFriendsIterator(profileId):ProfileIterator\\n    method createCoworkersIterator(profileId):ProfileIterator\\n\\n\\n// Each concrete collection is coupled to a set of concrete\\n// iterator classes it returns. But the client isn\\'t, since the\\n// signature of these methods returns iterator interfaces.\\nclass Facebook implements SocialNetwork is\\n    // ... The bulk of the collection\\'s code should go here ...\\n\\n    // Iterator creation code.\\n    method createFriendsIterator(profileId) is\\n        return new FacebookIterator(this, profileId, \"friends\")\\n    method createCoworkersIterator(profileId) is\\n        return new FacebookIterator(this, profileId, \"coworkers\")\\n\\n\\n// The common interface for all iterators.\\ninterface ProfileIterator is\\n    method getNext():Profile\\n    method hasMore():bool\\n\\n\\n// The concrete iterator class.\\nclass FacebookIterator implements ProfileIterator is\\n    // The iterator needs a reference to the collection that it\\n    // traverses.\\n    private field facebook: Facebook\\n    private field profileId, type: string\\n\\n    // An iterator object traverses the collection independently\\n    // from other iterators. Therefore it has to store the\\n    // iteration state.\\n    private field currentPosition\\n    private field cache: array of Profile\\n\\n    constructor FacebookIterator(facebook, profileId, type) is\\n        this.facebook = facebook\\n        this.profileId = profileId\\n        this.type = type\\n\\n    private method lazyInit() is\\n        if (cache == null)\\n            cache = facebook.socialGraphRequest(profileId, type)\\n\\n    // Each concrete iterator class has its own implementation\\n    // of the common iterator interface.\\n    method getNext() is\\n        if (hasMore())\\n            result = cache[currentPosition]\\n            currentPosition++\\n            return result\\n\\n    method hasMore() is\\n        lazyInit()\\n        return currentPosition < cache.length\\n\\n\\n// Here is another useful trick: you can pass an iterator to a\\n// client class instead of giving it access to a whole\\n// collection. This way, you don\\'t expose the collection to the\\n// client.\\n//\\n// And there\\'s another benefit: you can change the way the\\n// client works with the collection at runtime by passing it a\\n// different iterator. This is possible because the client code\\n// isn\\'t coupled to concrete iterator classes.\\nclass SocialSpammer is\\n    method send(iterator: ProfileIterator, message: string) is\\n        while (iterator.hasMore())\\n            profile = iterator.getNext()\\n            System.sendEmail(profile.getEmail(), message)\\n\\n\\n// The application class configures collections and iterators\\n// and then passes them to the client code.\\nclass Application is\\n    field network: SocialNetwork\\n    field spammer: SocialSpammer\\n\\n    method config() is\\n        if working with Facebook\\n            this.network = new Facebook()\\n        if working with LinkedIn\\n            this.network = new LinkedIn()\\n        this.spammer = new SocialSpammer()\\n\\n    method sendSpamToFriends(profile) is\\n        iterator = network.createFriendsIterator(profile.getId())\\n        spammer.send(iterator, \"Very important message\")\\n\\n    method sendSpamToCoworkers(profile) is\\n        iterator = network.createCoworkersIterator(profile.getId())\\n        spammer.send(iterator, \"Very important message\")\\nApplicability\\nUse the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).\\nThe iterator encapsulates the details of working with a complex data structure, providing the client with several simple methods of accessing the collection elements. While this approach is very convenient for the client, it also protects the collection from careless or malicious actions which the client would be able to perform if working with the collection directly.\\nUse the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.\\nThe code of non-trivial iteration algorithms tends to be very bulky. When placed within the business logic of an app, it may blur the responsibility of the original code and make it less maintainable. Moving the traversal code to designated iterators can help you make the code of the application more lean and clean.\\nUse the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of these structures are unknown beforehand.\\nThe pattern provides a couple of generic interfaces for both collections and iterators. Given that your code now uses these interfaces, it’ll still work if you pass it various kinds of collections and iterators that implement these interfaces.\\nHow to Implement\\nDeclare the iterator interface. At the very least, it must have a method for fetching the next element from a collection. But for the sake of convenience you can add a couple of other methods, such as fetching the previous element, tracking the current position, and checking the end of the iteration.\\nDeclare the collection interface and describe a method for fetching iterators. The return type should be equal to that of the iterator interface. You may declare similar methods if you plan to have several distinct groups of iterators.\\nImplement concrete iterator classes for the collections that you want to be traversable with iterators. An iterator object must be linked with a single collection instance. Usually, this link is established via the iterator’s constructor.\\nImplement the collection interface in your collection classes. The main idea is to provide the client with a shortcut for creating iterators, tailored for a particular collection class. The collection object must pass itself to the iterator’s constructor to establish a link between them.\\nGo over the client code to replace all of the collection traversal code with the use of iterators. The client fetches a new iterator object each time it needs to iterate over the collection elements.\\nPros and Cons\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can clean up the client code and the collections by extracting bulky traversal algorithms into separate classes.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can implement new types of collections and iterators and pass them to existing code without breaking anything.\\nYou can iterate over the same collection in parallel because each iterator object contains its own iteration state.\\nFor the same reason, you can delay an iteration and continue it when needed.\\nApplying the pattern can be an overkill if your app only works with simple collections.\\nUsing an iterator may be less efficient than going through elements of some specialized collections directly.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nYou can use\\nIterators\\nto traverse\\nComposite\\ntrees.\\nYou can use\\nFactory Method\\nalong with\\nIterator\\nto let collection subclasses return different types of iterators that are compatible with the collections.\\nYou can use\\nMemento\\nalong with\\nIterator\\nto capture the current iteration state and roll it back if necessary.\\nYou can use\\nVisitor\\nalong with\\nIterator\\nto traverse a complex data structure and execute some operation over its elements, even if they all have different classes.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained in

title:\\nMediator\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nMediator\\nAlso known as:\\nIntermediary,\\nController\\nIntent\\nMediator\\nis a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator\\xa0object.\\nProblem\\nSay you have a dialog for creating and editing customer profiles. It consists of various form controls such as text fields, checkboxes, buttons,\\xa0etc.\\nSome of the form elements may interact with others. For instance, selecting the “I have a dog” checkbox may reveal a hidden text field for entering the dog’s name. Another example is the submit button that has to validate values of all fields before saving the data.\\nElements can have lots of relations with other elements. Hence, changes to some elements may affect the\\xa0others.\\nBy having this logic implemented directly inside the code of the form elements you make these elements’ classes much harder to reuse in other forms of the app. For example, you won’t be able to use that checkbox class inside another form, because it’s coupled to the dog’s text field. You can use either all the classes involved in rendering the profile form, or none at all.\\nSolution\\nThe Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components which you want to make independent of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues.\\nIn our example with the profile editing form, the dialog class itself may act as the mediator. Most likely, the dialog class is already aware of all of its sub-elements, so you won’t even need to introduce new dependencies into this class.\\nUI elements should communicate indirectly, via the mediator\\xa0object.\\nThe most significant change happens to the actual form elements. Let’s consider the submit button. Previously, each time a user clicked the button, it had to validate the values of all individual form elements. Now its single job is to notify the dialog about the click. Upon receiving this notification, the dialog itself performs the validations or passes the task to the individual elements. Thus, instead of being tied to a dozen form elements, the button is only dependent on the dialog class.\\nYou can go further and make the dependency even looser by extracting the common interface for all types of dialogs. The interface would declare the notification method which all form elements can use to notify the dialog about events happening to those elements. Thus, our submit button should now be able to work with any dialog that implements that interface.\\nThis way, the Mediator pattern lets you encapsulate a complex web of relations between various objects inside a single mediator object. The fewer dependencies a class has, the easier it becomes to modify, extend or reuse that class.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nAircraft pilots don’t talk to each other directly when deciding who gets to land their plane next. All communication goes through the control\\xa0tower.\\nPilots of aircraft that approach or depart the airport control area don’t communicate directly with each other. Instead, they speak to an air traffic controller, who sits in a tall tower somewhere near the airstrip. Without the air traffic controller, pilots would need to be aware of every plane in the vicinity of the airport, discussing landing priorities with a committee of dozens of other pilots. That would probably skyrocket the airplane crash statistics.\\nThe tower doesn’t need to control the whole flight. It exists only to enforce constraints in the terminal area because the number of involved actors there might be overwhelming to a pilot.\\nStructure\\nComponents\\nare various classes that contain some business logic. Each component has a reference to a mediator, declared with the type of the mediator interface. The component isn’t aware of the actual class of the mediator, so you can reuse the component in other programs by linking it to a different mediator.\\nThe\\nMediator\\ninterface declares methods of communication with components, which usually include just a single notification method. Components may pass any context as arguments of this method, including their own objects, but only in such a way that no coupling occurs between a receiving component and the sender’s class.\\nConcrete Mediators\\nencapsulate relations between various components. Concrete mediators often keep references to all components they manage and sometimes even manage their lifecycle.\\nComponents must not be aware of other components. If something important happens within or to a component, it must only notify the mediator. When the mediator receives the notification, it can easily identify the sender, which might be just enough to decide what component should be triggered in return.\\nFrom a component’s perspective, it all looks like a total black box. The sender doesn’t know who’ll end up handling its request, and the receiver doesn’t know who sent the request in the first place.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nMediator\\npattern helps you eliminate mutual dependencies between various UI classes: buttons, checkboxes and text labels.\\nStructure of the UI dialog\\xa0classes.\\nAn element, triggered by a user, doesn’t communicate with other elements directly, even if it looks like it’s supposed to. Instead, the element only needs to let its mediator know about the event, passing any contextual info along with that notification.\\nIn this example, the whole authentication dialog acts as the mediator. It knows how concrete elements are supposed to collaborate and facilitates their indirect communication. Upon receiving a notification about an event, the dialog decides what element should address the event and redirects the call accordingly.\\n// The mediator interface declares a method used by components\\n// to notify the mediator about various events. The mediator may\\n// react to these events and pass the execution to other\\n// components.\\ninterface Mediator is\\n    method notify(sender: Component, event: string)\\n\\n\\n// The concrete mediator class. The intertwined web of\\n// connections between individual components has been untangled\\n// and moved into the mediator.\\nclass AuthenticationDialog implements Mediator is\\n    private field title: string\\n    private field loginOrRegisterChkBx: Checkbox\\n    private field loginUsername, loginPassword: Textbox\\n    private field registrationUsername, registrationPassword,\\n                  registrationEmail: Textbox\\n    private field okBtn, cancelBtn: Button\\n\\n    constructor AuthenticationDialog() is\\n        // Create all component objects by passing the current\\n        // mediator into their constructors to establish links.\\n\\n    // When something happens with a component, it notifies the\\n    // mediator. Upon receiving a notification, the mediator may\\n    // do something on its own or pass the request to another\\n    // component.\\n    method notify(sender, event) is\\n        if (sender == loginOrRegisterChkBx and event == \"check\")\\n            if (loginOrRegisterChkBx.checked)\\n                title = \"Log in\"\\n                // 1.

They could still communicate with each other, albeit indirectly, through a mediator object. To reuse a component in a different app, you need to provide it with a new mediator class.\\nUse the Mediator when you find yourself creating tons of component subclasses just to reuse some basic behavior in various contexts.\\nSince all relations between components are contained within the mediator, it’s easy to define entirely new ways for these components to collaborate by introducing new mediator classes, without having to change the components themselves.\\nHow to Implement\\nIdentify a group of tightly coupled classes which would benefit from being more independent (e.g., for easier maintenance or simpler reuse of these classes).\\nDeclare the mediator interface and describe the desired communication protocol between mediators and various components. In most cases, a single method for receiving notifications from components is sufficient.\\nThis interface is crucial when you want to reuse component classes in different contexts. As long as the component works with its mediator via the generic interface, you can link the component with a different implementation of the mediator.\\nImplement the concrete mediator class. Consider storing references to all components inside the mediator. This way, you could call any component from the mediator’s methods.\\nYou can go even further and make the mediator responsible for the creation and destruction of component objects. After this, the mediator may resemble a\\nfactory\\nor a\\nfacade\\n.\\nComponents should store a reference to the mediator object. The connection is usually established in the component’s constructor, where a mediator object is passed as an argument.\\nChange the components’ code so that they call the mediator’s notification method instead of methods on other components. Extract the code that involves calling other components into the mediator class. Execute this code whenever the mediator receives notifications from that component.\\nPros and Cons\\nSingle Responsibility Principle\\n. You can extract the communications between various components into a single place, making it easier to comprehend and maintain.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new mediators without having to change the actual components.\\nYou can reduce coupling between various components of a program.\\nYou can reuse individual components more easily.\\nOver time a mediator can evolve into a\\nGod Object\\n.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\n,\\nCommand\\n,\\nMediator\\nand\\nObserver\\naddress various ways of connecting senders and receivers of requests:\\nChain of Responsibility\\npasses a request sequentially along a dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles it.\\nCommand\\nestablishes unidirectional connections between senders and receivers.\\nMediator\\neliminates direct connections between senders and receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator object.\\nObserver\\nlets receivers dynamically subscribe to and unsubscribe from receiving requests.\\nFacade\\nand\\nMediator\\nhave similar jobs: they try to organize collaboration between lots of tightly coupled classes.\\nFacade\\ndefines a simplified interface to a subsystem of objects, but it doesn’t introduce any new functionality. The subsystem itself is unaware of the facade. Objects within the subsystem can communicate directly.\\nMediator\\ncentralizes communication between components of the system. The components only know about the mediator object and don’t communicate directly.\\nThe difference between\\nMediator\\nand\\nObserver\\nis often elusive. In most cases, you can implement either of these patterns; but sometimes you can apply both simultaneously. Let’s see how we can do that.\\nThe primary goal of\\nMediator\\nis to eliminate mutual dependencies among a set of system components. Instead, these components become dependent on a single mediator object. The goal of\\nObserver\\nis to establish dynamic one-way connections between objects, where some objects act as subordinates of others.\\nThere’s a popular implementation of the\\nMediator\\npattern that relies on\\nObserver\\n. The mediator object plays the role of publisher, and the components act as subscribers which subscribe to and unsubscribe from the mediator’s events. When\\nMediator\\nis implemented this way, it may look very similar to\\nObserver\\n.\\nWhen you’re confused, remember that you can implement the Mediator pattern in other ways. For example, you can permanently link all the components to the same mediator object. This implementation won’t resemble\\nObserver\\nbut will still be an instance of the Mediator pattern.\\nNow imagine a program where all components have become publishers, allowing dynamic connections between each other. There won’t be a centralized mediator object, only a distributed set of observers.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained in

title:\\nMemento\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nMemento\\nAlso known as:\\nSnapshot\\nIntent\\nMemento\\nis a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its\\xa0implementation.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you’re creating a text editor app. In addition to simple text editing, your editor can format text, insert inline images,\\xa0etc.\\nAt some point, you decided to let users undo any operations carried out on the text. This feature has become so common over the years that nowadays people expect every app to have it. For the implementation, you chose to take the direct approach. Before performing any operation, the app records the state of all objects and saves it in some storage. Later, when a user decides to revert an action, the app fetches the latest snapshot from the history and uses it to restore the state of all objects.\\nLet’s think about those state snapshots. How exactly would you produce one? You’d probably need to go over all the fields in an object and copy their values into storage. However, this would only work if the object had quite relaxed access restrictions to its contents. Unfortunately, most real objects won’t let others peek inside them that easily, hiding all significant data in private fields.\\nIgnore that problem for now and let’s assume that our objects behave like hippies: preferring open relations and keeping their state public. While this approach would solve the immediate problem and let you produce snapshots of objects’ states at will, it still has some serious issues. In the future, you might decide to refactor some of the editor classes, or add or remove some of the fields. Sounds easy, but this would also require changing the classes responsible for copying the state of the affected objects.\\nHow to make a copy of the object’s private\\xa0state?\\nBut there’s more. Let’s consider the actual “snapshots” of the editor’s state. What data does it contain? At a bare minimum, it must contain the actual text, cursor coordinates, current scroll position,\\xa0etc. To make a snapshot, you’d need to collect these values and put them into some kind of container.\\nMost likely, you’re going to store lots of these container objects inside some list that would represent the history. Therefore the containers would probably end up being objects of one class. The class would have almost no methods, but lots of fields that mirror the editor’s state. To allow other objects to write and read data to and from a snapshot, you’d probably need to make its fields public. That would expose all the editor’s states, private or not. Other classes would become dependent on every little change to the snapshot class, which would otherwise happen within private fields and methods without affecting outer classes.\\nIt looks like we’ve reached a dead end: you either expose all internal details of classes, making them too fragile, or restrict access to their state, making it impossible to produce snapshots. Is there any other way to implement the \"undo\"?\\nSolution\\nAll problems that we’ve just experienced are caused by broken encapsulation. Some objects try to do more than they are supposed to. To collect the data required to perform some action, they invade the private space of other objects instead of letting these objects perform the actual action.\\nThe Memento pattern delegates creating the state snapshots to the actual owner of that state, the\\noriginator\\nobject. Hence, instead of other objects trying to copy the editor’s state from the “outside,” the editor class itself can make the snapshot since it has full access to its own state.\\nThe pattern suggests storing the copy of the object’s state in a special object called\\nmemento\\n. The contents of the memento aren’t accessible to any other object except the one that produced it. Other objects must communicate with mementos using a limited interface which may allow fetching the snapshot’s metadata (creation time, the name of the performed operation,\\xa0etc.), but not the original object’s state contained in the snapshot.\\nThe originator has full access to the memento, whereas the caretaker can only access the\\xa0metadata.\\nSuch a restrictive policy lets you store mementos inside other objects, usually called\\ncaretakers\\n. Since the caretaker works with the memento only via the limited interface, it’s not able to tamper with the state stored inside the memento. At the same time, the originator has access to all fields inside the memento, allowing it to restore its previous state at will.\\nIn our text editor example, we can create a separate history class to act as the caretaker. A stack of mementos stored inside the caretaker will grow each time the editor is about to execute an operation. You could even render this stack within the app’s UI, displaying the history of previously performed operations to a user.\\nWhen a user triggers the undo, the history grabs the most recent memento from the stack and passes it back to the editor, requesting a roll-back. Since the editor has full access to the memento, it changes its own state with the values taken from the memento.\\nStructure\\nImplementation based on nested classes\\nThe classic implementation of the pattern relies on support for nested classes, available in many popular programming languages (such as C++, C#, and Java).\\nThe\\nOriginator\\nclass can produce snapshots of its own state, as well as restore its state from snapshots when needed.\\nThe\\nMemento\\nis a value object that acts as a snapshot of the originator’s state. It’s a common practice to make the memento immutable and pass it the data only once, via the constructor.\\nThe\\nCaretaker\\nknows not only “when” and “why” to capture the originator’s state, but also when the state should be restored.\\nA caretaker can keep track of the originator’s history by storing a stack of mementos. When the originator has to travel back in history, the caretaker fetches the topmost memento from the stack and passes it to the originator’s restoration method.\\nIn this implementation, the memento class is nested inside the originator. This lets the originator access the fields and methods of the memento, even though they’re declared private. On the other hand, the caretaker has very limited access to the memento’s fields and methods, which lets it store mementos in a stack but not tamper with their state.\\nImplementation based on an intermediate interface\\nThere’s an alternative implementation, suitable for programming languages that don’t support nested classes (yeah, PHP, I’m talking about you).\\nIn the absence of nested classes, you can restrict access to the memento’s fields by establishing a convention that caretakers can work with a memento only through an explicitly declared intermediary interface, which would only declare methods related to the memento’s metadata.\\nOn the other hand, originators can work with a memento object directly, accessing fields and methods declared in the memento class. The downside of this approach is that you need to declare all members of the memento public.\\nImplementation with even stricter encapsulation\\nThere’s another implementation which is useful when you don’t want to leave even the slightest chance of other classes accessing the state of the originator through the memento.\\nThis implementation allows having multiple types of originators and mementos. Each originator works with a corresponding memento class. Neither originators nor mementos expose their state to anyone.\\nCaretakers are now explicitly restricted from changing the state stored in mementos. Moreover, the caretaker class becomes independent from the originator because the restoration method is now defined in the memento class.\\nEach memento becomes linked to the originator that produced it. The originator passes itself to the memento’s constructor, along with the values of its state. Thanks to the close relationship between these classes, a memento can restore the state of its originator, given that the latter has defined the appropriate setters.\\nPseudocode\\nThis example uses the Memento pattern alongside the\\nCommand\\npattern for storing snapshots of the complex text editor’s state and restoring an earlier state from these snapshots when needed.\\nSaving snapshots of the text editor’s\\xa0state.\\nThe command objects act as caretakers. They fetch the editor’s memento before executing operations related to commands. When a user attempts to undo the most recent command, the editor can use the memento stored in that command to revert itself to the previous state.\\nThe memento class doesn’t declare any public fields, getters or setters. Therefore no object can alter its contents. Mementos are linked to the editor object that created them. This lets a memento restore the linked editor’s state by passing the data via setters on the editor object. Since mementos are linked to specific editor objects, you can make your app support several independent editor windows with a centralized undo stack.\\n// The originator holds some important data that may change over\\n// time. It also defines a method for saving its state inside a\\n// memento and another method for restoring the state from it.\\nclass Editor is\\n    private field text, curX, curY, selectionWidth\\n\\n    method setText(text) is\\n        this.text = text\\n\\n    method setCursor(x, y) is\\n        this.curX = x\\n        this.curY = y\\n\\n    method setSelectionWidth(width) is\\n        this.selectionWidth = width\\n\\n    // Saves the current state inside a memento.\\n    method createSnapshot():Snapshot is\\n        // Memento is an immutable object; that\\'s why the\\n        // originator passes its state to the memento\\'s\\n        // constructor parameters.\\n        return new Snapshot(this, text, curX, curY, selectionWidth)\\n\\n// The memento class stores the past state of the editor.\\nclass Snapshot is\\n    private field editor: Editor\\n    private field text, curX, curY, selectionWidth\\n\\n    constructor Snapshot(editor, text, curX, curY, selectionWidth) is\\n        this.editor = editor\\n        this.text = text\\n        this.curX = x\\n        this.curY = y\\n        this.selectionWidth = selectionWidth\\n\\n    // At some point, a previous state of the editor can be\\n    // restored using a memento object.\\n    method restore() is\\n        editor.setText(text)\\n        editor.setCursor(curX, curY)\\n        editor.setSelectionWidth(selectionWidth)\\n\\n// A command object can act as a caretaker. In that case, the\\n// command gets a memento just before it changes the\\n// originator\\'s state. When undo is requested, it restores the\\n// originator\\'s state from a memento.\\nclass Command is\\n    private field backup: Snapshot\\n\\n    method makeBackup() is\\n        backup = editor.createSnapshot()\\n\\n    method undo() is\\n        if (backup != null)\\n            backup.restore()\\n    // ...\\nApplicability\\nUse the Memento pattern when you want to produce snapshots of the object’s state to be able to restore a previous state of the object.\\nThe Memento pattern lets you make full copies of an object’s state, including private fields, and store them separately from the object. While most people remember this pattern thanks to the “undo” use case, it’s also indispensable when dealing with transactions (i.e., if you need to roll back an operation on error).\\nUse the pattern when direct access to the object’s fields/getters/setters violates its encapsulation.\\nThe Memento makes the object itself responsible for creating a snapshot of its state. No other object can read the snapshot, making the original object’s state data safe and secure.\\nHow to Implement\\nDetermine what class will play the role of the originator. It’s important to know whether the program uses one central object of this type or multiple smaller ones.\\nCreate the memento class. One by one, declare a set of fields that mirror the fields declared inside the originator class.\\nMake the memento class immutable. A memento should accept the data just once, via the constructor. The class should have no setters.\\nIf your programming language supports nested classes, nest the memento inside the originator. If not, extract a blank interface from the memento class and make all other objects use it to refer to the memento. You may add some metadata operations to the interface, but nothing that exposes the originator’s state.\\nAdd a method for producing mementos to the originator class. The originator should pass its state to the memento via one or multiple arguments of the memento’s constructor.\\nThe return type of the method should be of the interface you extracted in the previous step (assuming that you extracted it at all). Under the hood, the memento-producing method should work directly with the memento class.\\nAdd a method for restoring the originator’s state to its class. It should accept a memento object as an argument. If you extracted an interface in the previous step, make it the type of the parameter. In this case, you need to typecast the incoming object to the memento class, since the originator needs full access to that object.\\nThe caretaker, whether it represents a command object, a history, or something entirely different, should know when to request new mementos from the originator, how to store them and when to restore the originator with a particular memento.\\nThe link between caretakers and originators may be moved into the memento class. In this case, each memento must be connected to the originator that had created it. The restoration method would also move to the memento class. However, this would all make sense only if the memento class is nested into originator or the originator class provides sufficient setters for overriding its state.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can produce snapshots of the object’s state without violating its encapsulation.\\nYou can simplify the originator’s code by letting the caretaker maintain the history of the originator’s state.\\nThe app might consume lots of RAM if clients create mementos too often.\\nCaretakers should track the originator’s lifecycle to be able to destroy obsolete mementos.\\nMost dynamic programming languages, such as PHP, Python and JavaScript, can’t guarantee that the state within the memento stays untouched.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nYou can use\\nCommand\\nand\\nMemento\\ntogether when implementing “undo”. In this case, commands are responsible for performing various operations over a target object, while mementos save the state of that object just before a command gets executed.\\nYou can use\\nMemento\\nalong with\\nIterator\\nto capture the current iteration state and roll it back if necessary.\\nSometimes\\nPrototype\\ncan be a simpler alternative to\\nMemento\\n. This works if the object, the state of which you want to store in the history, is fairly straightforward and doesn’t have links to external resources, or the links are easy to re-establish.\\nCode

title:\\nObserver\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nObserver\\nAlso known as:\\nEvent-Subscriber,\\nListener\\nIntent\\nObserver\\nis a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re\\xa0observing.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you have two types of objects: a\\nCustomer\\nand a\\nStore\\n. The customer is very interested in a particular brand of product (say, it’s a new model of the iPhone) which should become available in the store very soon.\\nThe customer could visit the store every day and check product availability. But while the product is still en route, most of these trips would be pointless.\\nOn the other hand, the store could send tons of emails (which might be considered spam) to all customers each time a new product becomes available. This would save some customers from endless trips to the store. At the same time, it’d upset other customers who aren’t interested in new products.\\nIt looks like we’ve got a conflict. Either the customer wastes time checking product availability or the store wastes resources notifying the wrong customers.\\nSolution\\nThe object that has some interesting state is often called\\nsubject\\n, but since it’s also going to notify other objects about the changes to its state, we’ll call it\\npublisher\\n. All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher’s state are called\\nsubscribers\\n.\\nThe Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. Fear not! Everything isn’t as complicated as it sounds. In reality, this mechanism consists of 1) an array field for storing a list of references to subscriber objects and 2) several public methods which allow adding subscribers to and removing them from that list.\\nA subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event\\xa0notifications.\\nNow, whenever an important event happens to the publisher, it goes over its subscribers and calls the specific notification method on their objects.\\nReal apps might have dozens of different subscriber classes that are interested in tracking events of the same publisher class. You wouldn’t want to couple the publisher to all of those classes. Besides, you might not even know about some of them beforehand if your publisher class is supposed to be used by other people.\\nThat’s why it’s crucial that all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification.\\nPublisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their\\xa0objects.\\nIf your app has several different types of publishers and you want to make your subscribers compatible with all of them, you can go even further and make all publishers follow the same interface. This interface would only need to describe a few subscription methods. The interface would allow subscribers to observe publishers’ states without coupling to their concrete classes.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nMagazine and newspaper\\xa0subscriptions.\\nIf you subscribe to a newspaper or magazine, you no longer need to go to the store to check if the next issue is available. Instead, the publisher sends new issues directly to your mailbox right after publication or even in advance.\\nThe publisher maintains a list of subscribers and knows which magazines they’re interested in. Subscribers can leave the list at any time when they wish to stop the publisher sending new magazine issues to them.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nPublisher\\nissues events of interest to other objects. These events occur when the publisher changes its state or executes some behaviors. Publishers contain a subscription infrastructure that lets new subscribers join and current subscribers leave the list.\\nWhen a new event happens, the publisher goes over the subscription list and calls the notification method declared in the subscriber interface on each subscriber object.\\nThe\\nSubscriber\\ninterface declares the notification interface. In most cases, it consists of a single\\nupdate\\nmethod. The method may have several parameters that let the publisher pass some event details along with the update.\\nConcrete Subscribers\\nperform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn’t coupled to concrete classes.\\nUsually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers often pass some context data as arguments of the notification method. The publisher can pass itself as an argument, letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.\\nThe\\nClient\\ncreates publisher and subscriber objects separately and then registers subscribers for publisher updates.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nObserver\\npattern lets the text editor object notify other service objects about changes in its state.\\nNotifying objects about events that happen to other\\xa0objects.\\nThe list of subscribers is compiled dynamically: objects can start or stop listening to notifications at runtime, depending on the desired behavior of your app.\\nIn this implementation, the editor class doesn’t maintain the subscription list by itself. It delegates this job to the special helper object devoted to just that. You could upgrade that object to serve as a centralized event dispatcher, letting any object act as a publisher.\\nAdding new subscribers to the program doesn’t require changes to existing publisher classes, as long as they work with all subscribers through the same interface.\\n// The base publisher class includes subscription management\\n// code and notification methods.\\nclass EventManager is\\n    private field listeners: hash map of event types and listeners\\n\\n    method subscribe(eventType, listener) is\\n        listeners.add(eventType, listener)\\n\\n    method unsubscribe(eventType, listener) is\\n        listeners.remove(eventType, listener)\\n\\n    method notify(eventType, data) is\\n        foreach (listener in listeners.of(eventType)) do\\n            listener.update(data)\\n\\n// The concrete publisher contains real business logic that\\'s\\n// interesting for some subscribers. We could derive this class\\n// from the base publisher, but that isn\\'t always possible in\\n// real life because the concrete publisher might already be a\\n// subclass. In this case, you can patch the subscription logic\\n// in with composition, as we did here.\\nclass Editor is\\n    public field events: EventManager\\n    private field file: File\\n\\n    constructor Editor() is\\n        events = new EventManager()\\n\\n    // Methods of business logic can notify subscribers about\\n    // changes.\\n    method openFile(path) is\\n        this.file = new File(path)\\n        events.notify(\"open\", file.name)\\n\\n    method saveFile() is\\n        file.write()\\n        events.notify(\"save\", file.name)\\n\\n    // ...\\n\\n\\n// Here\\'s the subscriber interface. If your programming language\\n// supports functional types, you can replace the whole\\n// subscriber hierarchy with a set of functions.\\ninterface EventListener is\\n    method update(filename)\\n\\n// Concrete subscribers react to updates issued by the publisher\\n// they are attached to.\\nclass LoggingListener implements EventListener is\\n    private field log: File\\n    private field message: string\\n\\n    constructor LoggingListener(log_filename, message) is\\n        this.log = new File(log_filename)\\n        this.message = message\\n\\n    method update(filename) is\\n        log.write(replace(\\'%s\\',filename,message))\\n\\nclass EmailAlertsListener implements EventListener is\\n    private field email: string\\n    private field message: string\\n\\n    constructor EmailAlertsListener(email, message) is\\n        this.email = email\\n        this.message = message\\n\\n    method update(filename) is\\n        system.email(email, replace(\\'%s\\',filename,message))\\n\\n\\n// An application can configure publishers and subscribers at\\n// runtime.\\nclass Application is\\n    method config() is\\n        editor = new Editor()\\n\\n        logger = new LoggingListener(\\n            \"/path/to/log.txt\",\\n            \"Someone has opened the file: %s\")\\n        editor.events.subscribe(\"open\", logger)\\n\\n        emailAlerts = new EmailAlertsListener(\\n            \"admin@example.com\",\\n            \"Someone has changed the file: %s\")\\n        editor.events.subscribe(\"save\", emailAlerts)\\nApplicability\\nUse the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.\\nYou can often experience this problem when working with classes of the graphical user interface. For example, you created custom button classes, and you want to let the clients hook some custom code to your buttons so that it fires whenever a user presses a button.\\nThe Observer pattern lets any object that implements the subscriber interface subscribe for event notifications in publisher objects. You can add the subscription mechanism to your buttons, letting the clients hook up their custom code via custom subscriber classes.\\nUse the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.\\nThe subscription list is dynamic, so subscribers can join or leave the list whenever they need to.\\nHow to Implement\\nLook over your business logic and try to break it down into two parts: the core functionality, independent from other code, will act as the publisher; the rest will turn into a set of subscriber classes.\\nDeclare the subscriber interface. At a bare minimum, it should declare a single\\nupdate\\nmethod.\\nDeclare the publisher interface and describe a pair of methods for adding a subscriber object to and removing it from the list. Remember that publishers must work with subscribers only via the subscriber interface.\\nDecide where to put the actual subscription list and the implementation of subscription methods. Usually, this code looks the same for all types of publishers, so the obvious place to put it is in an abstract class derived directly from the publisher interface. Concrete publishers extend that class, inheriting the subscription behavior.\\nHowever, if you’re applying the pattern to an existing class hierarchy, consider an approach based on composition: put the subscription logic into a separate object, and make all real publishers use it.\\nCreate concrete publisher classes. Each time something important happens inside a publisher, it must notify all its subscribers.\\nImplement the update notification methods in concrete subscriber classes. Most subscribers would need some context data about the event. It can be passed as an argument of the notification method.\\nBut there’s another option. Upon receiving a notification, the subscriber can fetch any data directly from the notification. In this case, the publisher must pass itself via the update method. The less flexible option is to link a publisher to the subscriber permanently via the constructor.\\nThe client must create all necessary subscribers and register them with proper publishers.\\nPros and Cons\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher’s code (and vice versa if there’s a publisher interface).\\nYou can establish relations between objects at runtime.\\nSubscribers are notified in random order.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\n,\\nCommand\\n,\\nMediator\\nand\\nObserver\\naddress various ways of connecting senders and receivers of requests:\\nChain of Responsibility\\npasses a request sequentially along a dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles it.\\nCommand\\nestablishes unidirectional connections between senders and receivers.\\nMediator\\neliminates direct connections between senders and receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator object.\\nObserver\\nlets receivers dynamically subscribe to and unsubscribe from receiving requests.\\nThe difference between\\nMediator\\nand\\nObserver\\nis often elusive. In most cases, you can implement either of these patterns; but sometimes you can apply both simultaneously. Let’s see how we can do that.\\nThe primary goal of\\nMediator\\nis to eliminate mutual dependencies among a set of system components. Instead, these components become dependent on a single mediator object. The goal of\\nObserver\\nis to establish dynamic one-way connections between objects, where some objects act as subordinates of others.\\nThere’s a popular implementation of the\\nMediator\\npattern that relies on\\nObserver\\n. The mediator object plays the role of publisher, and the components act as subscribers which subscribe to and unsubscribe from the mediator’s events. When\\nMediator\\nis implemented this way, it may look very similar to\\nObserver\\n.\\nWhen you’re confused, remember that you can implement the Mediator pattern in other ways. For example, you can permanently link all the components to the same mediator object. This implementation won’t resemble\\nObserver\\nbut will still be an instance of the Mediator pattern.\\nNow imagine a program where all components have become publishers, allowing dynamic connections between each other. There won’t be a centralized mediator object, only a distributed set of observers.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design patterns and 8 principles explained in depth.\\n409 well-structured, easy to read, jargon-free pages.\\n225 clear and helpful illustrations and diagrams.\\nAn archive with code examples in 11 languages.\\nAll devices supported: PDF/EPUB/MOBI/KFX formats.\\nLearn more…\\nRead next\\nState\\nReturn\\nMemento\\nThis article is a part of our eBook\\nDive Into Design Patterns\\n.\\nLearn more…\\nPremium Content\\nDesign Patterns eBook\\nRefactoring Course\\nRefactoring\\nWhat is Refactoring\\nClean code\\nTechnical debt\\nWhen to refactor\\nHow to refactor\\nCatalog\\nCode Smells\\nBloaters\\nLong Method\\nLarge Class\\nPrimitive Obsession\\nLong Parameter List\\nData Clumps\\nObject-Orientation Abusers\\nSwitch Statements\\nTemporary Field\\nRefused Bequest\\nAlternative Classes with Different Interfaces\\nChange Preventers\\nDivergent Change\\nShotgun Surgery\\nParallel Inheritance Hierarchies\\nDispensables\\nComments\\nDuplicate Code\\nLazy Class\\nData Class\\nDead Code\\nSpeculative Generality\\nCouplers\\nFeature Envy\\nInappropriate Intimacy\\nMessage Chains\\nMiddle Man\\nOther Smells\\nIncomplete Library Class\\nRefactorings\\nComposing Methods\\nExtract Method\\nInline Method\\nExtract Variable\\nInline Temp\\nReplace Temp with Query\\nSplit Temporary Variable\\nRemove Assignments to Parameters\\nReplace Method with Method Object\\nSubstitute Algorithm\\nMoving Features between Objects\\nMove Method\\nMove Field\\nExtract Class\\nInline Class\\nHide Delegate\\nRemove Middle Man\\nIntroduce Foreign Method\\nIntroduce Local Extension\\nOrganizing Data\\nSelf Encapsulate Field\\nReplace Data Value with Object\\nChange Value to Reference\\nChange Reference to Value\\nReplace Array with Object\\nDuplicate Observed Data\\nChange Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional\\nChange Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional\\nReplace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant\\nEncapsulate Field\\nEncapsulate Collection\\nReplace Type Code with Class\\nReplace Type Code with Subclasses\\nReplace Type Code with State/Strategy\\nReplace Subclass with Fields\\nSimplifying Conditional Expressions\\nDecompose Conditional\\nConsolidate Conditional Expression\\nConsolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments\\nRemove Control Flag\\nReplace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses\\nReplace Conditional with Polymorphism\\nIntroduce Null Object\\nIntroduce Assertion\\nSimplifying Method Calls\\nRename Method\\nAdd Parameter\\nRemove Parameter\\nSeparate Query from Modifier\\nParameterize Method\\nReplace Parameter with Explicit Methods\\nPreserve Whole Object\\nReplace Parameter with Method Call\\nIntroduce Parameter Object\\nRemove Setting Method\\nHide Method\\nReplace Constructor with Factory Method\\nReplace Error Code with Exception\\nReplace Exception with Test\\nDealing with Generalization\\nPull Up Field\\nPull Up Method\\nPull Up Constructor Body\\nPush Down Method\\nPush Down Field\\nExtract Subclass\\nExtract Superclass\\nExtract Interface\\nCollapse Hierarchy\\nForm Template Method\\nReplace Inheritance with Delegation\\nReplace Delegation with Inheritance\\nDesign Patterns\\nWhat is a Pattern\\nWhat\\'s a design pattern?\\nHistory of patterns\\nWhy should I learn patterns?\\nCriticism of patterns\\nClassification of patterns\\nCatalog\\nCreational Patterns\\nFactory Method\\nAbstract Factory\\nBuilder\\nPrototype\\nSingleton\\nStructural Patterns\\nAdapter\\nBridge\\nComposite\\nDecorator\\nFacade\\nFlyweight\\nProxy\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\nCommand\\nIterator\\nMediator\\nMemento\\nObserver\\nState\\nStrategy\\nTemplate Method\\nVisitor\\nCode Examples\\nC#\\nC++\\nGo\\nJava\\nPHP\\nPython\\nRuby\\nRust\\nSwift\\nTypeScript\\nSign in\\nContact us\\nShop Now!\\nEnglish\\nEnglish\\nEspañol\\nFrançais\\n日本語\\n한국어\\nPolski\\nPortuguês Brasileiro\\nРусский\\nУкраїнська\\n中文\\nContact us\\nSign in\\nHome\\nRefactoring\\nDesign Patterns\\nPremium Content\\nForum\\nContact us\\n2014-2025\\nRefactoring.Guru\\n.\\nAll rights reserved.\\nIllustrations by\\nDmitry Zhart\\nTerms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nContent Usage Policy\\nAbout us\\nUkrainian office:\\nFOP Olga Skobeleva\\nAbolmasova 7\\nKyiv, Ukraine, 02002\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\nSpanish office:\\nOleksandr Shvets\\nAvda Pamplona 64\\nPamplona, Spain, 31009\\nEmail: support@refactoring.guru\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nWebpage title:\\nStrategy\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nStrategy\\nIntent\\nStrategy\\nis a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects\\xa0interchangeable.\\nProblem\\nOne day you decided to create a navigation app for casual travelers. The app was centered around a beautiful map which helped users quickly orient themselves in any city.\\nOne of the most requested features for the app was automatic route planning. A user should be able to enter an address and see the fastest route to that destination displayed on the map.\\nThe first version of the app could only build the routes over roads. People who traveled by car were bursting with joy. But apparently, not everybody likes to drive on their vacation. So with the next update, you added an option to build walking routes. Right after that, you added another option to let people use public transport in their routes.\\nHowever, that was only the beginning. Later you planned to add route building for cyclists. And even later, another option for building routes through all of a city’s tourist attractions.\\nWhile from a business perspective the app was a success, the technical part caused you many headaches. Each time you added a new routing algorithm, the main class of the navigator doubled in size. At some point, the beast became too hard to maintain.\\nAny change to one of the algorithms, whether it was a simple bug fix or a slight adjustment of the street score, affected the whole class, increasing the chance of creating an error in already-working code.\\nIn addition, teamwork became inefficient. Your teammates, who had been hired right after the successful release, complain that they spend too much time resolving merge conflicts. Implementing a new feature requires you to change the same huge class, conflicting with the code produced by other people.\\nSolution\\nThe Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms into separate classes called\\nstrategies\\n.\\nThe original class, called\\ncontext\\n, must have a field for storing a reference to one of the strategies. The context delegates the work to a linked strategy object instead of executing it on its own.\\nThe context isn’t responsible for selecting an appropriate algorithm for the job. Instead, the client passes the desired strategy to the context. In fact, the context doesn’t know much about strategies. It works with all strategies through the same generic interface, which only exposes a single method for triggering the algorithm encapsulated within the selected strategy.\\nThis way the context becomes independent of concrete strategies, so you can add new algorithms or modify existing ones without changing the code of the context or other strategies.\\nRoute planning\\xa0strategies.\\nIn our navigation app, each routing algorithm can be extracted to its own class with a single\\nbuildRoute\\nmethod. The method accepts an origin and destination and returns a collection of the route’s checkpoints.\\nEven though given the same arguments, each routing class might build a different route, the main navigator class doesn’t really care which algorithm is selected since its primary job is to render a set of checkpoints on the map. The class has a method for switching the active routing strategy, so its clients, such as the buttons in the user interface, can replace the currently selected routing behavior with another one.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nVarious strategies for getting to the\\xa0airport.\\nImagine that you have to get to the airport. You can catch a bus, order a cab, or get on your bicycle. These are your transportation strategies. You can pick one of the strategies depending on factors such as budget or time constraints.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nContext\\nmaintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies and communicates with this object only via the strategy interface.\\nThe\\nStrategy\\ninterface is common to all concrete strategies. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.\\nConcrete Strategies\\nimplement different variations of an algorithm the context uses.\\nThe context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesn’t know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.\\nThe\\nClient\\ncreates a specific strategy object and passes it to the context. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the context uses multiple\\nstrategies\\nto execute various arithmetic operations.\\n// The strategy interface declares operations common to all\\n// supported versions of some algorithm. The context uses this\\n// interface to call the algorithm defined by the concrete\\n// strategies.\\ninterface Strategy is\\n    method execute(a, b)\\n\\n// Concrete strategies implement the algorithm while following\\n// the base strategy interface. The interface makes them\\n// interchangeable in the context.\\nclass ConcreteStrategyAdd implements Strategy is\\n    method execute(a, b) is\\n        return a + b\\n\\nclass ConcreteStrategySubtract implements Strategy is\\n    method execute(a, b) is\\n        return a - b\\n\\nclass ConcreteStrategyMultiply implements Strategy is\\n    method execute(a, b) is\\n        return a * b\\n\\n// The context defines the interface of interest to clients.\\nclass Context is\\n    // The context maintains a reference to one of the strategy\\n    // objects. The context doesn\\'t know the concrete class of a\\n    // strategy. It should work with all strategies via the\\n    // strategy interface.\\n    private strategy: Strategy\\n\\n    // Usually the context accepts a strategy through the\\n    // constructor, and also provides a setter so that the\\n    // strategy can be switched at runtime.\\n    method setStrategy(Strategy strategy) is\\n        this.strategy = strategy\\n\\n    // The context delegates some work to the strategy object\\n    // instead of implementing multiple versions of the\\n    // algorithm on its own.\\n    method executeStrategy(int a, int b) is\\n        return strategy.execute(a, b)\\n\\n\\n// The client code picks a concrete strategy and passes it to\\n// the context. The client should be aware of the differences\\n// between strategies in order to make the right choice.\\nclass ExampleApplication is\\n    method main() is\\n        Create context object.\\n\\n        Read first number.\\n        Read last number.\\n        Read the desired action from user input.\\n\\n        if (action == addition) then\\n            context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyAdd())\\n\\n        if (action == subtraction) then\\n            context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategySubtract())\\n\\n        if (action == multiplication) then\\n            context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyMultiply())\\n\\n        result = context.executeStrategy(First number, Second number)\\n\\n        Print result.\\nApplicability\\nUse the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.\\nThe Strategy pattern lets you indirectly alter the object’s behavior at runtime by associating it with different sub-objects which can perform specific sub-tasks in different ways.\\nUse the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.\\nThe Strategy pattern lets you extract the varying behavior into a separate class hierarchy and combine the original classes into one, thereby reducing duplicate code.\\nUse the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.\\nThe Strategy pattern lets you isolate the code, internal data, and dependencies of various algorithms from the rest of the code. Various clients get a simple interface to execute the algorithms and switch them at runtime.\\nUse the pattern when your class has a massive conditional statement that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.\\nThe Strategy pattern lets you do away with such a conditional by extracting all algorithms into separate classes, all of which implement the same interface. The original object delegates execution to one of these objects, instead of implementing all variants of the algorithm.\\nHow to Implement\\nIn the context class, identify an algorithm that’s prone to frequent changes. It may also be a massive conditional that selects and executes a variant of the same algorithm at runtime.\\nDeclare the strategy interface common to all variants of the algorithm.\\nOne by one, extract all algorithms into their own classes. They should all implement the strategy interface.\\nIn the context class, add a field for storing a reference to a strategy object. Provide a setter for replacing values of that field. The context should work with the strategy object only via the strategy interface. The context may define an interface which lets the strategy access its data.\\nClients of the context must associate it with a suitable strategy that matches the way they expect the context to perform its primary job.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can swap algorithms used inside an object at runtime.\\nYou can isolate the implementation details of an algorithm from the code that uses it.\\nYou can replace inheritance with composition.\\nOpen/Closed Principle\\n. You can introduce new strategies without having to change the context.\\nIf you only have a couple of algorithms and they rarely change, there’s no real reason to overcomplicate the program with new classes and interfaces that come along with the pattern.\\nClients must be aware of the differences between strategies to be able to select a proper one.\\nA lot of modern programming languages have functional type support that lets you implement different versions of an algorithm inside a set of anonymous functions. Then you could use these functions exactly as you’d have used the strategy objects, but without bloating your code with extra classes and interfaces.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nBridge\\n,\\nState\\n,\\nStrategy\\n(and to some degree\\nAdapter\\n) have very similar structures. Indeed, all of these patterns are based on composition, which is delegating work to other objects. However, they all solve different problems. A pattern isn’t just a recipe for structuring your code in a specific way. It can also communicate to other developers the problem the pattern solves.\\nCommand\\nand\\nStrategy\\nmay look similar because you can use both to parameterize an object with some action. However, they have very different intents.\\nYou can use\\nCommand\\nto convert any operation into an object. The operation’s parameters become fields of that object. The conversion lets you defer execution of the operation, queue it, store the history of commands, send commands to remote services,\\xa0etc.\\nOn the other hand,\\nStrategy\\nusually describes different ways of doing the same thing, letting you swap these algorithms within a single context class.\\nDecorator\\nlets you change the skin of an object, while\\nStrategy\\nlets you change the guts.\\nTemplate Method\\nis based on inheritance: it lets you alter parts of an algorithm by extending those parts in subclasses.\\nStrategy\\nis based on composition: you can alter parts of the object’s behavior by supplying it with different strategies that correspond to that behavior.\\nTemplate Method\\nworks at the class level, so it’s static.\\nStrategy\\nworks on the object level, letting you switch behaviors at runtime.\\nState\\ncan be considered as an extension of\\nStrategy\\n. Both patterns are based on composition: they change the behavior of the context by delegating some work to helper objects.\\nStrategy\\nmakes these objects completely independent and unaware of each other. However,\\nState\\ndoesn’t restrict dependencies between concrete states, letting them alter the state of the context at will.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22 design

title:\\nTemplate Method\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\n/\\nDesign Patterns\\n/\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nTemplate Method\\nIntent\\nTemplate Method\\nis a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its\\xa0structure.\\nProblem\\nImagine that you’re creating a data mining application that analyzes corporate documents. Users feed the app documents in various formats (PDF, DOC, CSV), and it tries to extract meaningful data from these docs in a uniform format.\\nThe first version of the app could work only with DOC files. In the following version, it was able to support CSV files. A month later, you “taught” it to extract data from PDF files.\\nAt some point, you noticed that all three classes have a lot of similar code. While the code for dealing with various data formats was entirely different in all classes, the code for data processing and analysis is almost identical. Wouldn’t it be great to get rid of the code duplication, leaving the algorithm structure intact?\\nThere was another problem related to client code that used these classes. It had lots of conditionals that picked a proper course of action depending on the class of the processing object. If all three processing classes had a common interface or a base class, you’d be able to eliminate the conditionals in client code and use polymorphism when calling methods on a processing object.\\nSolution\\nThe Template Method pattern suggests that you break down an algorithm into a series of steps, turn these steps into methods, and put a series of calls to these methods inside a single\\ntemplate method.\\nThe steps may either be\\nabstract\\n, or have some default implementation. To use the algorithm, the client is supposed to provide its own subclass, implement all abstract steps, and override some of the optional ones if needed (but not the template method itself).\\nLet’s see how this will play out in our data mining app. We can create a base class for all three parsing algorithms. This class defines a template method consisting of a series of calls to various document-processing steps.\\nTemplate method breaks the algorithm into steps, allowing subclasses to override these steps but not the actual\\xa0method.\\nAt first, we can declare all steps\\nabstract\\n, forcing the subclasses to provide their own implementations for these methods. In our case, subclasses already have all necessary implementations, so the only thing we might need to do is adjust signatures of the methods to match the methods of the superclass.\\nNow, let’s see what we can do to get rid of the duplicate code. It looks like the code for opening/closing files and extracting/parsing data is different for various data formats, so there’s no point in touching those methods. However, implementation of other steps, such as analyzing the raw data and composing reports, is very similar, so it can be pulled up into the base class, where subclasses can share that code.\\nAs you can see, we’ve got two types of steps:\\nabstract steps\\nmust be implemented by every subclass\\noptional steps\\nalready have some default implementation, but still can be overridden if needed\\nThere’s another type of step, called\\nhooks\\n. A hook is an optional step with an empty body. A template method would work even if a hook isn’t overridden. Usually, hooks are placed before and after crucial steps of algorithms, providing subclasses with additional extension points for an algorithm.\\nReal-World Analogy\\nA typical architectural plan can be slightly altered to better fit the client’s\\xa0needs.\\nThe template method approach can be used in mass housing construction. The architectural plan for building a standard house may contain several extension points that would let a potential owner adjust some details of the resulting house.\\nEach building step, such as laying the foundation, framing, building walls, installing plumbing and wiring for water and electricity,\\xa0etc., can be slightly changed to make the resulting house a little bit different from others.\\nStructure\\nThe\\nAbstract Class\\ndeclares methods that act as steps of an algorithm, as well as the actual template method which calls these methods in a specific order. The steps may either be declared\\nabstract\\nor have some default implementation.\\nConcrete Classes\\ncan override all of the steps, but not the template method itself.\\nPseudocode\\nIn this example, the\\nTemplate Method\\npattern provides a “skeleton” for various branches of artificial intelligence in a simple strategy video game.\\nAI classes of a simple video\\xa0game.\\nAll races in the game have almost the same types of units and buildings. Therefore you can reuse the same AI structure for various races, while being able to override some of the details. With this approach, you can override the orcs’ AI to make it more aggressive, make humans more defense-oriented, and make monsters unable to build anything. Adding a new race to the game would require creating a new AI subclass and overriding the default methods declared in the base AI class.\\n// The abstract class defines a template method that contains a\\n// skeleton of some algorithm composed of calls, usually to\\n// abstract primitive operations. Concrete subclasses implement\\n// these operations, but leave the template method itself\\n// intact.\\nclass GameAI is\\n    // The template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm.\\n    method turn() is\\n        collectResources()\\n        buildStructures()\\n        buildUnits()\\n        attack()\\n\\n    // Some of the steps may be implemented right in a base\\n    // class.\\n    method collectResources() is\\n        foreach (s in this.builtStructures) do\\n            s.collect()\\n\\n    // And some of them may be defined as abstract.\\n    abstract method buildStructures()\\n    abstract method buildUnits()\\n\\n    // A class can have several template methods.\\n    method attack() is\\n        enemy = closestEnemy()\\n        if (enemy == null)\\n            sendScouts(map.center)\\n        else\\n            sendWarriors(enemy.position)\\n\\n    abstract method sendScouts(position)\\n    abstract method sendWarriors(position)\\n\\n// Concrete classes have to implement all abstract operations of\\n// the base class but they must not override the template method\\n// itself.\\nclass OrcsAI extends GameAI is\\n    method buildStructures() is\\n        if (there are some resources) then\\n            // Build farms, then barracks, then stronghold.\\n\\n    method buildUnits() is\\n        if (there are plenty of resources) then\\n            if (there are no scouts)\\n                // Build peon, add it to scouts group.\\n            else\\n                // Build grunt, add it to warriors group.\\n\\n    // ...\\n\\n    method sendScouts(position) is\\n        if (scouts.length > 0) then\\n            // Send scouts to position.\\n\\n    method sendWarriors(position) is\\n        if (warriors.length > 5) then\\n            // Send warriors to position.\\n\\n// Subclasses can also override some operations with a default\\n// implementation.\\nclass MonstersAI extends GameAI is\\n    method collectResources() is\\n        // Monsters don\\'t collect resources.\\n\\n    method buildStructures() is\\n        // Monsters don\\'t build structures.\\n\\n    method buildUnits() is\\n        // Monsters don\\'t build units.\\nApplicability\\nUse the Template Method pattern when you want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure.\\nThe Template Method lets you turn a monolithic algorithm into a series of individual steps which can be easily extended by subclasses while keeping intact the structure defined in a superclass.\\nUse the pattern when you have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms with some minor differences. As a result, you might need to modify all classes when the algorithm changes.\\nWhen you turn such an algorithm into a template method, you can also pull up the steps with similar implementations into a superclass, eliminating code duplication. Code that varies between subclasses can remain in subclasses.\\nHow to Implement\\nAnalyze the target algorithm to see whether you can break it into steps. Consider which steps are common to all subclasses and which ones will always be unique.\\nCreate the abstract base class and declare the template method and a set of abstract methods representing the algorithm’s steps. Outline the algorithm’s structure in the template method by executing corresponding steps. Consider making the template method\\nfinal\\nto prevent subclasses from overriding it.\\nIt’s okay if all the steps end up being abstract. However, some steps might benefit from having a default implementation. Subclasses don’t have to implement those methods.\\nThink of adding hooks between the crucial steps of the algorithm.\\nFor each variation of the algorithm, create a new concrete subclass. It\\nmust\\nimplement all of the abstract steps, but\\nmay\\nalso override some of the optional ones.\\nPros and Cons\\nYou can let clients override only certain parts of a large algorithm, making them less affected by changes that happen to other parts of the algorithm.\\nYou can pull the duplicate code into a superclass.\\nSome clients may be limited by the provided skeleton of an algorithm.\\nYou might violate the\\nLiskov Substitution Principle\\nby suppressing a default step implementation via a subclass.\\nTemplate methods tend to be harder to maintain the more steps they have.\\nRelations with Other Patterns\\nFactory Method\\nis a specialization of\\nTemplate Method\\n. At the same time, a\\nFactory Method\\nmay serve as a step in a large\\nTemplate Method\\n.\\nTemplate Method\\nis based on inheritance: it lets you alter parts of an algorithm by extending those parts in subclasses.\\nStrategy\\nis based on composition: you can alter parts of the object’s behavior by supplying it with different strategies that correspond to that behavior.\\nTemplate Method\\nworks at the class level, so it’s static.\\nStrategy\\nworks on the object level, letting you switch behaviors at runtime.\\nCode Examples\\nSupport our free website and own the eBook!\\n22

title:\\nDesign Patterns in TypeScript\\nWebpage Content:\\nWINTER SALE IS ON!\\nThe Catalog of\\nTypeScript\\nExamples\\nCreational Patterns\\nAbstract Factory\\nLets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nBuilder\\nLets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nFactory Method\\nProvides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nPrototype\\nLets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their\\xa0classes.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nSingleton\\nLets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nStructural Patterns\\nAdapter\\nAllows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nBridge\\nLets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nComposite\\nLets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nDecorator\\nLets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nFacade\\nProvides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nFlyweight\\nLets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nProxy\\nLets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nBehavioral Patterns\\nChain of Responsibility\\nLets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nCommand\\nTurns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request\\'s execution, and support undoable operations.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nIterator\\nLets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nMediator\\nLets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nMemento\\nLets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nObserver\\nLets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they\\'re observing.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nState\\nLets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nStrategy\\nLets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nTemplate Method\\nDefines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.\\nMain article\\nUsage in TypeScript\\nCode example\\nVisitor\\nLets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.\\nMain

       "\n",
       "**Definition**: Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Concepts\n",
       "- **Clean Code**: Writing code that is easy to understand and maintain.\n",
       "- **Technical Debt**: The eventual costs incurred when choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\n",
       "- **When to Refactor**: Refactor when you notice code smells, like long methods, duplicated code, or complex conditionals.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Assignment\n",
       "- Identify a piece of code in one of your projects that could benefit from refactoring. List the code smell types present and propose a refactoring plan.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "## Design Patterns Overview\n",

       "\n",
       "## Course Overview\n",
       "This course is designed to teach you about Conventional Commits—a specification that aims to add human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. You will learn the structure, types, footers, and benefits of using Conventional Commits. By the end of this course, you should be comfortable implementing this specification in your projects.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Course Outline\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Introduction to Conventional Commits\n",
       "- **What are Conventional Commits?**\n",
       "  - A lightweight convention on top of commit messages.\n",
       "  - Facilitates explicit commit history and automation tools.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Relation to Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**\n",
       "  - Describes features, fixes, and breaking changes in commits.\n",
       "  \n",
       "### 2. Structure of Commit Messages\n",
       "- **Basic Structure**\n",
       "  ```\n",
       "  <type>[optional scope]: <description>\n",
       "\n",
       "  [optional body]\n",
       "\n",
       "  [optional footer(s)]\n",
       "  ```\n",
       "- **Elements Explained:**\n",
       "  - `type`: Specifies the nature of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`).\n",
       "  - `scope`: Optional; specifies a section of the codebase (e.g., `parser`).\n",
       "  - `description`: A concise description of the change.\n",
       "  - `body`: Optional; provides further details.\n",
       "  - `footer`: Optional; includes additional information like breaking changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Types of Commits\n",
       "- **Core Types:**\n",
       "  - `fix`: Bug fix (correlates with PATCH in SemVer).\n",
       "  - `feat`: New feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer).\n",
       "  - `BREAKING CHANGE`: Indicates breaking API change.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Additional Types (recommended but optional)**\n",
       "  - `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. Breaking Changes\n",
       "- **Identification**\n",
       "  - Use `!` after the type/scope or mention `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Examples:**\n",
       "  ```\n",
       "  feat(api)!: send email upon shipment\n",
       "  BREAKING CHANGE: The API endpoint for sending email has changed.\n",
       "  ```\n",
       "\n",
       "### 5. Footers in Commit Messages\n",
       "- **Format**\n",
       "  - Must have the format: `<word-token>: <value>` or `<word-token> #<issue number>`.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Examples**\n",
       "  - `BREAKING CHANGE: <detail>`\n",
       "  - `Reviewed-by: Z`\n",
       "  - `Refs: #123`\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. Why Use Conventional Commits?\n",
       "- Automatically generate CHANGELOGs.\n",
       "- Determine semantic version bump based on commit types.\n",
       "- Improve communication regarding changes in the codebase.\n",
       "- Facilitate contributions from others.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 7. Common Questions & FAQ\n",
       "- **Q: How do I handle initial development phase commits?**\n",
       "  - Treat them as production-ready for transparency.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Q: What if I used the wrong commit type?**\n",
       "  - Use `git rebase -i` before merging to correct it.\n",
